</div>


<p>In writing this book I have taken it as a commonplace
that everyone&mdash;man, woman, and child&mdash;wants to be
strong. Without strength&mdash;and by strength I mean
health, vitality, and a general sense of physical well-being&mdash;life
is but a gloomy business. Wealth, talent,
ambition, the love and affection of friends, the pleasure
derived from doing good to those about one, all these
things may afford some consolation for being deprived
of life’s chief blessing, but they can never make up for
it. “But,” I am constantly being asked, “it is all very
well for you to say this, and everyone of sense agrees
with you; the point is, can we obtain this much-prized
blessing?” In the vast majority of cases I can say unhesitatingly
“Yes.” You can all be strong, all enjoy the
heritage which was intended for you. Not all to the
same extent, perhaps. Those who are afflicted with
some hereditary disease, who may have unsound organs
handed down to them, cannot reasonably expect to get
such results as their more fortunate brethren. Still,
even they need not despair; even if their condition be
such as to put out of the question any such thing as
athletics, they can, at all events, attain to such a condition
as will permit of their enjoying life, and render
them fit to carry on their work without difficulty. And
after all, those who wish to be strong for this reason are
innumerable. It is only the young and vigorous who
desire to excel in athletic pastimes, but the middle-aged
and elderly, the delicate women and young children,
who yearn for health are countless. I claim that by
carefully following out my system, as set out in the following
pages, and fully illustrated in the Anatomical
Chart at the end of the volume, these results may be
attained.</p>

</div>


<p>It is nearly two years since the first edition of “Strength
and How to Obtain it” was published, and its success
has been very gratifying to me. It plainly demonstrates
that the people of my adopted country are
gradually beginning to understand and appreciate what
is meant by “physical culture,” and that my ideas are
steadily taking root in productive ground. I am, therefore,
encouraged to bring out a new edition of the book,
which, I trust, will be an improvement upon its predecessor.
Several chapters have been added and a few
inaccuracies and ambiguities remedied, and I trust the
book in its new form will find favour with my readers.
I wish to draw particular attention to chapters V. and
VIII., in which I refer to “My ‘Grip’ Dumb-bell” and
to “Physical Culture for Women.” There are various
other additions to which I need not refer here.
Sufficient to say that during the past eighteen months I
have learned much, and that so far as lies in my power
I have endeavoured to give the benefit of such knowledge
as I have acquired to all who believe with me that
the cultivation of the body is a sacred and imperative
duty.</p>

<small>CONCERNING PHYSICAL CULTURE.</small></h3></div>


<p>It is curious to me to look back a year or two and to
reflect upon the change in public opinion upon this subject
which has taken place in so short a time. When I
first began to preach the “gospel of health and
strength” the general tendency was to make fun of me.
Some people called me a fool; others, a charlatan.
Very few indeed took the trouble to see whether there
was anything in my theories, and to test for themselves
their truth or falsity. That was, so to speak, only
yesterday; what an alteration, and an alteration for the
better, is to be observed to-day. I shall not be accused of
undue egotism if I say that my ideas have “caught on.”
All over the country, among the young, “physical
culture” is now the rage, and that it is no mere passing
fancy is proved by the fact that those who are no longer
in their first youth are its equally devoted, though
possibly less feverish, disciples.</p>

<p>“And what is physical culture?” is naturally the
question which arises to the lips of those to whom the
subject is still unfamiliar. Let me begin by saying
what it <i>is not</i>. To begin with, to suppose, as many
people do suppose, that athletics and physical culture
are the same thing is quite a mistaken notion. Then is
physical culture opposed to athletics? Certainly not.
Cricket and football and rowing and swimming, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
indeed, all forms of manly sport and exercise, are admirable
things in their way, but they are not physical
culture. A part of it, if you like; but physical culture
is something far wider in its scope, infinitely loftier in
its ideals.</p>

<p>What was the ideal of the Greeks? They were ardent
athletes, but their pastimes were only regarded as a
means to an end. The Greeks regarded the culture
of the body as a sacred duty; their aim was to bring it
to the highest possible state of power and beauty, and
we know how they succeeded. Surely what they succeeded
in doing cannot be impossible for us.</p>

<p>Does the reader now begin to get a clearer idea of
what is meant by physical culture? As I have previously
said, it is to the body what culture, in the accepted
sense of the word, is to the mind. To constantly
and persistently cultivate the whole of the body so that
at last it shall be capable of anything that sound organs
and perfectly developed muscles can accomplish&mdash;that is
physical culture. The production, in short, of an
absolutely perfect body&mdash;that is physical culture. To
undo the evil for which civilization, and all the drawbacks
it has brought in its train, have been responsible
in making man regard his body lightly&mdash;that is the aim
of physical culture. I think I am justified in saying
that while it embraces every variety of athletics it goes
very much further.</p>

<p>Possibly there are people who will refuse to admit
that this aim is in itself a desirable one. They may say
that the sound body is only valuable in so far as it enables
the sound mind to perform its work. This I regard
as nonsensical cant. I absolutely and strenuously refuse
to allow for an instant that the cultivation of the body is,
<i>per se</i>, a comparatively valueless thing. On the contrary,
I maintain that he who neglects his body&mdash;and not to
cultivate it <i>is</i> to neglect it&mdash;is guilty of the worst sin;
for he sins against Nature. I take my stand upon this
then&mdash;that the care of the body is in itself an absolutely
good thing, and its neglect is no more to be excused
than is the neglect of the opportunities of mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
advancement which have been placed in a man’s way.
I am quite aware that it takes a very long time to
thoroughly free ourselves from the trammels of old-established
prejudice. I am quite prepared to hear of
some worthy folk gravely shaking their heads and deprecating
any great amount of attention being paid to the
body as likely to engender undue vanity and self-esteem.
I do not think that is likely to be so, but even if it
should be the case I do not hold it to be such a
grievous matter. If a man has striven his utmost to
make the best of himself a certain amount of pride in
the fact may well be forgiven him. Or, at all events,
we can look upon his failing with the eye of charity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not think I can conclude this chapter better than
by reprinting some remarks on the subject which I wrote
in the first number of “Physical Culture,” my monthly
magazine. The article was carefully thought out, and I
do not think there is any need for me to add to it.
“For after all, why should not a man feel some pride in
a healthy and well-cared-for body? Though I contend
that it in itself is emphatically a good thing, that is not
to say the effects of physical culture are confined to the
body. In bringing the body to its highest pitch of
perfection, various moral qualities, the value of which it
would be difficult to over-estimate, must necessarily be
brought into play. The first essential to success is the
power of concentrating the will upon the work.
Muscles are not developed by muscular action alone.
Physical exertion, however arduous and long continued,
will not make a man strong, or the day labourer and the
blacksmith would be the strongest of men. Mechanical
and desultory exertion will never materially increase a
man’s strength. He must first learn the great secret,
which ought to be no secret at all. He must use his
mind. He may not be able to add a cubit to his stature,
but by taking thought a man can most assuredly
increase the size of his muscles, strengthen all his organs,
and add to his general vitality. But he must put his
mind, as well as his muscles, into the work. And by
exercise and practice the will-power is greatly increased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
until, in course of time, the whole organism is so
absolutely under its control that the muscles can be
kept in perfect condition even without what, in ordinary
language, is called “exercise.” That is to say, that without
violent exertion, but merely by the exertion of the
will, the muscles can be exercised almost to any extent.
Can it for a moment be supposed that this cultivation
of the will-power is not of great value to an individual,
no matter what sort of task or work he may be engaged
in? Is it not largely by the exercise of will-power that
most things are achieved? Take two men of equal
talents; give them equal opportunities; but let one’s
will-power and power of concentration be relatively
much greater than his fellow’s. Then set them to perform
the same task. Which will succeed best? No
person endowed with ordinary intelligence can be in
doubt for a moment. Will-power is a mighty factor&mdash;perhaps
the mightiest&mdash;in all that goes to make up the
sum of human success or failure. But the strengthening
of will&mdash;though perhaps the chief&mdash;is not by a long way
the only benefit which physical culture confers. The
man who means to make his body as nearly perfect as
possible must perforce cultivate habits of self-control
and of temperance. Not the temperance which consists of
rigidly abstaining from all the ‘pleasant vices,’ but the
<i>real</i> temperance which teaches a man to say ‘No,’ which
teaches him to indulge in all that is conducive to happiness
without being in danger of that overstepping of the
boundary line which leads to misery. The man who has
cultivated his body has also cultivated self-respect. He
has learned the virtue and the happiness of rigid personal
cleanliness; his views of life are sane and wholesome.
Respecting himself he learns to respect others.
He is gentle, and only uses his powers against his fellowmen
when called upon to do so in the defence of the
oppressed and helpless. It is your weakling who is
generally a bully and a tyrant. To take a few men who
are exceptionally endowed by Nature, to make them
extraordinarily strong, and to then train them to perform
particular feats, is not a thing very difficult of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
accomplishment. But that is not the aim of physical
culture. Its ultimate object is to raise the average
standard of the race as a whole. That is, no doubt, a
stupendous task, and one which it may take many lifetimes
to accomplish. But everything must have its
beginning, and unless we set about improving the
physique of the present generation, we cannot hope to
benefit those who come after us. Healthier and more
perfect men and women will beget children with better
constitutions and more free from hereditary taint.
They in their turn, if the principles and the duty of
physical culture are early instilled into them, will grow
up more perfect types of men and women than were
their mothers and fathers. So the happy progression
will go on, until, who knows, if in the days to come there
will not be a race of mortals walking this earth of ours
even surpassing those who, according to the old myth,
were the offspring of the union of the sons of the gods
with the daughters of men! That is, perhaps, an
almost impossible ideal, but it is well to set one’s ideals
high. Surely what has been done for the horse and the
dog cannot be impossible of accomplishment in the case
of man. At all events, it is worth trying.”</p>

<p>To wind up this chapter with a word of encouragement
to those who come quite fresh to the subject; to
those who in taking up Physical Culture are venturing
into what is to them unexplored territory&mdash;“Read,
think, and work. Do not be disheartened because your
progress at first seems slow; nothing worth having is to
be won without labour. I can only tell you what to do,
only point out to you the right road. The rest lies with
yourself. I should be the sorriest humbug if I
endeavoured to make you believe otherwise, and you
would be the simplest of fools if you <i>did</i> believe me.
There is no royal road to success, and a very bad thing
would it be if there were. For your reward lies not so
much in the accomplishment as in the effort and
struggle, and all the good qualities which they bring
out.”</p>

<small>THE PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM.</small></h3></div>


<p>I have already remarked upon the satisfactory progress
which the system has made during the last few
years. It is probably well-known that my system has
practically been adopted in the Army; although the
method adopted in the Army gymnasia is not absolutely
identical with that which I advocate, it is obviously
based upon the same principles. People may be
interested to hear that since I opened my first school,
some eighteen months ago, amongst my pupils have
been a great number of gentlemen, who, desirous of
adopting the Army as a career, have been unable to do
so through not coming up to the physical standpoint
required. In many cases they have actually been
rejected on this account; in others they have been
fearful that such might be their fate, and have come to
me in order to avoid it. Some have not been heavy
enough for their height; others lacking in chest
measurement, and so on. Now let my system be judged
by the results. <i>In not a single instance have I failed to
do what is necessary.</i> That may stand by itself without
any further comment from me. However, as a further
proof of the efficacy of the system, I may say that I have
put an <i>inch</i> on the <i>height</i> of a young fellow in <i>three
weeks</i>! This may sound incredible, but it is an absolute
fact. The majority of these gentlemen, whom I have
helped to pass the Army “medical,” have written me
appreciative letters, and though for obvious reasons I
cannot publish them, I shall be happy to show them to
any reader who may care to call at the St. James’-street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
school. That the value of the system is fully recognised
in the Army is demonstrated by the letter from Colonel
Fox, late inspector of the Army Gymnasia, which
appears in this book. Amongst the civilian public the
system is spreading rapidly; private individuals are
taking it up and working steadily in their own homes,
whilst in a great number of gymnasia throughout the
country, classes are being formed to carry it out. In
connection with this, it is highly diverting to notice that
various individuals who are never tired of denouncing
me and all my works, have set up as “professors” of
physical culture, and are actually teaching my system!
Of course they would be loth to admit this, and would
assert that it is a system of their own. All I can say is
that by a strange coincidence nearly every one of these
systems which I have examined is based upon the same
principles as my own. Now that I have made mention
of those who try to gain notoriety by attacking my
system, I cannot refrain from commenting upon certain
statements which, having been widely circulated, may
tend to do the system injury. The subject is, I think,
worthy of a short chapter to itself.</p>

<small>THE STUPIDITY OF ENVY.</small></h3></div>


<p>The statement to which I refer is this&mdash;that
though by my system a man may increase the size
of his muscles, add to his bodily strength, and improve
his physique, he does so at the expense of his vital
organs. This statement has been freely bandied about
by those who ought to be above such petty and stupid
malice; men, who, professing to teach physical culture,
are mostly quite ignorant of the very rudiments of the
subject. Their reasons for such utterances are not far
to seek; they are envious of the success which has
attended the years of hard work and endeavour I have
gone through, and regard me as a rival to damage whom
everything is justifiable. One or two have even gone so
far as to say that I myself am anything but sound, that
my heart is in a very bad condition, and that there is
every probability of my “going over to the majority” at
a very early age.</p>

<p>Let me nail these outrageous lies to the counter once
and for all. Some who repeat them doubtless do so in
good faith; let them listen and amend their ways. For
those who circulated them, well knowing them to be
false, I have no words in which to express my contempt.
Fair and square opposition I can face; but a lie, however
groundless, once sent on its journey is difficult to
overtake.</p>

<p>Now for my refutation. First, amongst my pupils
have been many who, prior to coming to me, had been
rejected as unsound by Life Insurance Companies; well,
they have got their policies safely locked up now. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
had weak hearts, some poor lungs, others were generally
unfit. They came to me, generally, for two or three
months, applied again, and were accepted. Those who
doubt my word can, as in the case of the Army lads, see
the proofs for themselves. Is that good enough, or does
“our friend, the enemy,” require any further demonstration
that, far from injuring the vital organs, in many
cases my system is enormously beneficial to those who
are delicate. If so, here it is. They say <i>I</i> am unsound;
very well, here is an answer for them.</p>

<p>Some months ago I was insured for a large sum in the
Norwich Union Life Insurance Company; I was
accepted in the <i>highest class</i>, and the doctor who saw me
expressed great surprise at the soundness of my heart,
the strength of my lungs, and in fact at the fine condition
of all my organs. Surely these envious people show
little ingenuity in inventing falsehoods which can be so
easily disproved.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>HOW TO EXERCISE.</small></h3></div>


<p>In commencing the system of exercises described and
illustrated by the anatomical chart, there are certain
questions which every student naturally asks himself.</p>

<p>Probably the very first of these questions is, “What
part of the day ought I to devote to these exercises?”</p>

<p>The answer to this question must depend on the pupil
himself&mdash;on his leisure and on his inclination. Some
persons find the early morning the best and most convenient
time; others prefer the afternoon; and a third
class, again, find that they feel best, and have the most
leisure, at night. I do not, therefore, lay down a hard
and fast rule of time. The golden rule is to select such
part of the day as suits you best, always avoiding
exercise immediately after meals. If possible, let two
hours elapse between a meal and exercise. Moreover,
do not exercise just before going to bed if you find it
has a tendency to keep you awake. Many of my pupils
find that they sleep much better after exercise; but
there are some upon whom it has a reverse effect.</p>

<p>If possible, the pupil should always exercise stripped
to the waist; if he wear a singlet it should be cut well
away round the arms, so as to allow of free play for the
muscles around the shoulder. It is also desirable to
exercise before a looking-glass, for then the movements
of the various muscles can be followed, and to see the
muscles at work, and to mark their steady development,
is itself a help and a pleasure.</p>

<p>In performing the exercises the pupil should bend the
knees slightly and keep the muscles of the thighs tense;
the legs will thus share in the benefit of all the
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>What I wish to impress on delicate pupils is the desirability
of progress by degrees. Many men before
beginning my system of physical training have
been so weak that doctors have thought little of the
prospect of saving their lives, yet to-day they are
amongst the strongest. They have progressed gradually,
always being careful not to undertake too much, and
thus to adapt the exercises to their own individual
requirements. It may be mentioned also that the old,
as well as the young, may derive great benefits from my
system, though all who are over the age of fifty should
moderate the exercises on the lines suggested in the
table of ages for pupils between fifteen and seventeen.
My exercises will also be found of considerable benefit
to persons who suffer from obesity.</p>

<p>Pupils must not be discouraged because, after the first
few days’ training, they may feel stiff. It sometimes
happens that a young man or woman, or perhaps a
middle-aged one, sets out on the course of training with
the greatest enthusiasm. After the first two or three
days the enthusiasm, perhaps, wears off. Then comes a
period of stiffness, and the pupil is inclined to think
that he cannot be bothered to proceed with the course.
To such pupils, I would say, in all earnestness, “Don’t
be overcome by apparent difficulties; if you wish to
succeed, go forward; never draw back.” This stiffness,
moreover, becomes a very pleasant feeling. You soon
grow to like it; personally, indeed, it may be said that
it is one of the most agreeable sensations I have ever
had.</p>

<p>Frequently pupils ask me how long it should take
them to get strong. The answer again depends on
themselves, not only on their physical constitution, but
also on the amount of will power they put into their
exercises. As I have said already, it is the brain that
developers the muscles. Brain will do as much as dumb-bells,
even more. For example, when you are sitting
down reading, practise contracting your muscles. Do
this every time you are sitting down leisurely, and by
contracting them harder and harder each time, you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
find that it will have the same effect as the use of dumb-bells
or any more vigorous form of exercise.</p>

<p>It is very advisable for all pupils to get into the habit of
constantly practising this muscle-contraction. In itself
it is an admirable exercise, but it is perhaps even more
valuable owing to the fact that it improves the will
power and helps to establish that connection between
the brain and the muscles which is the basis of strength
and “condition.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that throughout my exercises I
make a point of alternate movements. By this means
one arm, or, as the case may be, one set of muscles, is
given a momentary rest whilst the other is in motion,
and thus freer circulation is gained than by performing
the movements simultaneously and the strain upon the
heart and lungs relieved.</p>

<p>Another question which pupils are constantly asking
me is whether it is right for them to perspire after the
exercises. The answer to this question is that it
depends on the constitution of the pupil. If you perspire,
it does you good; if you do not it shows that your
condition is sound already. Of course it will be understood
that I am answering in this, as in other questions,
for general cases. There are always exceptions.</p>

<p>Again, “What,” it is asked, “are the general benefits
of the Sandow system of physical training?”</p>

<p>The benefits are not, of course, confined to the visible
muscular development. The inner organs of the body
also share them. The liver and kidneys are kept in
good order, the heart and nerves are strengthened, the
brain and energy are braced up. The body, in fact, like
a child, wants to be educated, and only through a series
of exercises can this education be given. By its aid the
whole body is developed and, as will be seen, pupils
who have conscientiously worked at my system testify
freely to the good results obtained, not only in the
direction of vastly increasing their muscular strength,
but of raising the standard of their vitality and general
health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>For the beginner the most difficult part of my system
is so fully to concentrate his mind on his muscles as to
get them absolutely under control. It will be found,
however, that this control comes by degrees. The brain
sends a message to the muscles; the nerves receive it,
and pass it on to them. With regard to the will power
that is exerted it should be remembered that whilst the
effect of weight lifting is to contract the muscles, the
same effect is produced by merely contracting the
muscles without lifting the weight.</p>

<p>This question of “will power” has, I am aware,
troubled a good many of my pupils. The majority find
it difficult to “put all they know” into movements with
small dumb-bells, and consequently are apt to be disappointed
at the results of their work. Not infrequently
I have received a letter stating that the writer
is doing the exercises an immense number of times,
occupying several hours a day&mdash;three or four or even
more!&mdash;and yet does not find that there is very much
improvement. The reason is obvious; he is simply
“going through” the motions and not really working
at them. On the other hand, here and there, I come
across a man possessing an amount of will power out of
all proportion to his strength. The consequence is that
he soon gets exhausted, and either cannot get through
his exercises or only does so at the cost of becoming
thoroughly done up and jaded. The great rule that
progress in the direction of the exertion of will power
should be gradual and ever continuing, is one that many
people confess they are unable to carry out.</p>

<p>Now I have for long been perplexed to find a means
of remedying this, and at last I think I have discovered
a method whereby the amount of will-power exerted by
the pupil can be regulated. In the next chapter particulars
are given of my new “Grip” Dumb-bell, which
I think ought to prove a veritable godsend to all, and
especially to those to whom reference has just been
made.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />


<small>MY “GRIP” DUMB-BELL.</small></h3></div>


<p>This appliance is very simple and may be described in
a few words. It consists of a dumb-bell made in two
halves separated about an inch and a half from one
another, the intervening space being occupied by a small
steel spring. When exercising, the spring is compressed
by gripping the bells and bringing the two halves close
together, in which position they are kept until the exercise
is over. The springs can be of any strength, and
consequently the power necessary to keep the two halves
together can be varied to any extent.</p>

<p>The advantages of this arrangement are obvious.
Whether he will or no, the pupil <i>must grip</i> the bells
hard, and as the strength of the springs are known he
can regulate his progress to a nicety as he grows
stronger. There is also another point in connection
with the new device to which I want to draw particular
attention. It will often happen that a pupil who is
exercising will feel “a bit off-colour” one day, and consequently
less inclined to exercise, or he may be worried
and perplexed by his business affairs to a degree which
lenders it almost impossible for him to concentrate his
mind solely upon the work. The natural consequence
of either of these two conditions is that unless he
possess very uncommon will power, if he is exercising
with ordinary bells, he only does so in a desultory and
half-hearted manner, and benefits little thereby. Now
this is impossible with the “grip” bell&mdash;however preoccupied
and worried the pupil may be he has a definite
point upon which to concentrate his mind; he <i>must</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
exert a certain amount of force in gripping the bells to
keep the two halves together, and consequently <i>must</i>
put out a certain amount of will-power.</p>

<p>Of course there is no reason why in using the “grip”
dumb-bells, only the grip necessary to keep the two
halves together should be exerted. On the contrary, as
with ordinary bells, a man may, and should put “all he
knows” into the work; the special point and the great
merit about the former is that with them the amount
of power exerted can never fall below a known and easily
regulated <i>minimum</i>.</p>

<p>The pupil who possesses these bells will find that instead
of having to be continually buying heavier dumb-bells,
one pair will suffice him for all time. All that it
will be necessary for him to do will be to purchase, at a
small expense, new springs from time to time. All
pupils are advised to use the dumb-bell, upon the merits
of which I need not further enlarge. As will have been
seen, this is not a mechanical device which will render
unnecessary the employment of will-power; that would
be opposed to all my theories and teaching. On the
contrary it will aid in developing will-power, as it will
stimulate the pupil to put it forth, and guide him how
to use it in the proper direction.</p>

<small>THE MAGIC COLD BATH.</small></h3></div>


<p>I am sometimes accused of being a bit of a faddist
about the use of the cold bath, and possibly the heading
of this chapter may give strength to that opinion. But
its exhilarating and health-giving effects really justify
the use of the adjective. The longer I live, and the
greater my experience, the more am I convinced of its
virtues. Let me advise every pupil after exercising,
while the body is still hot, to take a cold bath. It does
not matter how much he may be perspiring; the cold
bath will prove exceedingly beneficial. He must be
careful, however, not to take his bath if he is out of
breath. The exercises will, no doubt, quicken the
heart’s action; but in from three to five minutes after
the series is completed, the heart should be beating
normally again. For persons who suffer from weak
heart I should not advise a cold bath. As a general rule
there is no need to ask the question, “Is my heart
weak?” For if it is weak you should know it beyond
a doubt. After every little exertion, though the assertion
may appear paradoxical, you will feel it beating in
your head.</p>

<p>In advising cold baths, I speak, of course, for persons
in the enjoyment of ordinary health. The bath should
be begun in the summer and continued every morning
throughout the year. In the winter, if the room is cold,
light the gas and close the window. If your hair is not
injuriously affected by cold water&mdash;and in many cases,
I believe, cold water will be found to strengthen it&mdash;begin,
as you stand over the bath, by splashing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
water five and twenty times over your head. In any
case, if you are averse to wetting the hair, be careful
to begin by sponging the temples and nape of the neck.
Next, whilst still standing over the bath, splash the
water fifteen times against the chest and ten times
against the heart. Then jump into the bath, going
right down under the water. In the summer you may
remain in the water from ten to fifteen seconds, but in
the winter let it be just a jump in and out again.</p>

<p>The subsequent rub down with towels is popularly
supposed to produce half the benefits that result from a
cold bath. I have no hesitation in saying that this is
a great mistake. Let me explain the reason: As you
get out of the bath you rub down first one part of the
body and then the other, and thus, whilst the one part
is being warmed by the friction, the other is getting
cold. Many people who take cold baths in this way
complain of touches of rheumatism, and the whole
trouble arises, I believe, from different parts of the body
being alternately warmed and chilled.</p>

<p>In order to overcome the risk of this ill-effect my
advice is this: Do not spend any time over rubbing
yourself down. If you do not like the idea of getting
into your clothes wet, just take the water off the body
as quickly as you possibly can with a dry towel, jump
into your clothes, and let Nature restore your circulation
in her own way. You will get quite as warm by
this method as by vigorously rubbing down, with the
added advantage that the heat of the body will be more
evenly distributed. If, owing to poor health or other
exceptional causes, the circulation is not fully and
promptly restored, walk briskly up and down the room.
If you should still feel cold in any part of the body
probably the bath is not suited to your constitution, and
in that case it is not advised. In ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred, however, the cold bath, taken as I have
described, will have nothing but the most beneficial
effects; and, if taken every morning throughout the
year, it is the surest preventive that I know against
catching cold. On the other hand, irregularity is liable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to produce cold. In short, having once begun the cold
bath, make a rule, summer and winter, never to leave
it off.</p>

<p>Personally, I find the very best form of the cold bath
is to get into your clothes after it without drying the
body at all. For the first moment or two the sensation
may not be perfectly agreeable, but afterwards you feel
better and warmer for adopting this method. The damp
is carried away through the clothes and no particle of
wet is left.</p>

<p>For pupils who have not the convenience of a bathroom
a cold sponging down may be recommended as a
substitute. In this case let two towels be taken and
soaked with water. Rub the front of the body down
with one, and the back with the other. This method
prevents the towel from absorbing the heat from the
body, and the cold sponging is thus distributed evenly
over its surface. Afterwards dry the body quickly as
before, letting no time be lost in getting into your
clothes.</p>

<p>I have often been asked whether in the event of
exercising at night it is advisable to take a cold bath
afterwards. My reply is:—“certainly.” <i>Always</i> have a
cold bath or sponge down after exercising. It will make
you feel “as fresh as paint,” improve your appetite, and
make the skin clean and firm, and be generally conducive
to happiness and good health. Some people tell me
that a cold bath immediately before retiring keeps them
awake; if that be so, I should advise them to exercise
earlier in the day. But the exercise and the cold bath
ought to be regarded as inseparable.</p>

<small>PHYSICAL CULTURE FOR THE MIDDLE-AGED.</small></h3></div>


<p>It is scarcely necessary for me to say that the benefits
to be obtained by conscientiously working upon my
system are by no means confined to the young and
vigorous. On the contrary, it is particularly suitable
for the middle-aged, who are all too apt to suffer from
the effects of the period of physical indolence which has
succeeded their youthful activity. To such, the system
should prove invaluable. It is quite a false notion to
suppose that when once youth is passed exercise is no
longer necessary. <i>So long as life lasts, if an individual
wants to keep healthy, exercise is just as necessary as food.</i>
It is through neglecting to recognise this that so many
men become aged before their time. When a man
begins to get into middle life he has a natural tendency
to “take things easy.” He lives more luxuriously,
devotes more time to the pleasures, of the table, and
exerts himself as little as possible. Is it anything to
wonder at that his health suffers, that he grows fat and
flabby, and that his digestive apparatus quickly gets out
of gear? If in his youth he has been an athlete the
more will his changed mode of life tell upon him; it is
indeed better never to have exercised at all than to exercise
for a few years and then drop it entirely. It is for
this reason we hear of the health of so many athletes
failing them at a comparatively early age. And this
failure is, as a rule, erroneously ascribed to the effects
upon their constitution of their early efforts. Once and
again errors in “training” may be responsible for poor
health in middle-age, but in ninety-nine cases out of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
hundred the complete cessation from active bodily work,
combined with the greater indulgence which naturally
follows, is alone responsible.</p>

<p>Of course, while it is advisable that the middle-aged
man should exercise regularly, I must warn him not to
do too much. He must remember that what is perfectly
safe and prudent at five-and-twenty may be rash and
hazardous at fifty; in short, that he, while exercising
consistently and steadily, must be careful not to over-tax
his powers. If he bears this in mind he will find that
the discomforts and ailments which he has perhaps got
to regard as natural to his time of life are quickly
banished, and that, in spite of his grey beard and
thinning hair, it is still “good to be alive.”</p>

<small>PHYSICAL CULTURE FOR WOMEN.</small></h3></div>


<p>I am exceedingly anxious to remove the impression,
which has, I fear, gained ground, that my system is not
a thing for women. Now-a-days, when women have practically
freed themselves from the antiquated ideas of a
generation or so ago, there ought to be small difficulty in
convincing them that to make the best of themselves, in a
physical sense, is just as imperative a duty for them as for
their brothers. Women go in for all sorts of sports and
pastimes to-day; they bicycle, row, play tennis and
hockey, and not infrequently display no small degree of
excellence in sports which have hitherto been regarded
as “for men only.” This is a hopeful sign, but I am not
at all sure that in many cases it is not more provocative
of harm than good. Women are possessed of a great
amount of nervous energy, and, unless their bodies and
organs are gradually and systematically trained to bear
exertion and fatigue, they are likely to attempt performances
which are quite beyond their physical power,
although, buoyed up as they are by a fund of nervous
energy and mental exhilaration, they may observe no ill-effects
at the time. This is one reason why it is so
advisable for women to commence by working upon my
system, which is so mild and gradual that they can
pursue it without any risks, and, while daily growing
stronger and healthier, be scarcely conscious that they
are making any effort whatever.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that there is a very wide-spread
notion that exercise tends to coarsen and render a
woman unbeautiful, but that is absolutely false. Were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
there any truth in it I should indeed despair of converting
my fair readers to my way of thinking, for truly
it is woman’s mission to look beautiful. But the idea
is absurd; Nature, which intended woman to look
lovely, also intended her to be healthy; indeed, the two
are practically synonymous. Of course, improper,
violent and one-sided exercise will naturally result in
making a woman clumsy, heavy, and ungraceful, but
proper exercise, having for its object symmetrical and
perfect development, will have an exactly contrary
effect. Curiously enough, the visible effect of proper
exercise upon a woman’s muscles is not precisely the
same as upon those of a man. Regular and gradually
progressive exercise will not make a woman’s muscles
prominent, but will cause them to grow firm and round
and impart to the outline of the figure those graceful
contours which are so universally admired. Without
well-conditioned muscle the most beautifully proportioned
woman in the world will look comparatively
shapeless and flabby; her muscles are not required to
show up as in the case of a man’s, but they must be
there all the same as a solid foundation for the overlying
flesh. Take a woman’s arm, for instance; if it has
been duly exercised and developed, it is easy enough to
see that its shapeliness and good modelling are due to
the muscles; white and soft though the skin may be,
you can tell at a glance that it is firm and elastic to the
touch. On the other hand, the arm of the woman who
has never exercised the muscles, betrays the fact unmistakably;
it may be plump and round, but its lines are
lacking in beauty, its movements in grace; and so with
the figure generally.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The effects of my system are very rapidly noticeable.
It reduces the size of the waist, makes the limbs round,
the figure pliant, the walk and carriage graceful and
easy. For those women who are doomed to a more or
less sedentary life it works wonders, and those whose
means and occupation permit of their indulging in a
healthier outdoor life will find it a splendid preparation
for their favourite pastimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Just a word with regard to complexion. A fine skin
and a good healthy colour are the best proofs of the
possession of good health. Indeed, without health a
good skin and complexion are out of the question; and
where is the woman who does not desire to possess both?
She is indeed rare. Therefore, to those women who,
while they do not set a high enough value upon health and
strength for their own sakes, yet desire to be fair to look
upon, I say the two things must inevitably go hand in
hand. Whether your prime object be to obtain beauty
or health does not matter; by working upon my system
you will obtain both.</p>

<small>THE TABLES OF AGES.</small></h3></div>


<p>From the following tables pupils of all ages will be
able to see at a glance how many times the movements
of each exercise illustrated by the anatomical chart
should be practised daily.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that the tables are
only intended as a guide, and that they are not intended
to arbitrarily fix the amount of work which the pupil
should do. It is an absolute impossibility to lay down
rules which will suit every individual case, and consequently
pupils must, after taking the table as a basis,
use their own discretion as to how they shall vary them.
The great thing to bear in mind is to proceed very
gradually; while exercising, put “all you know” into
the work, but don’t attempt to do too much. Exercise
until the muscles ache, but never go on to the point of
feeling thoroughly “blown” and exhausted. A quarter
of an hour’s conscientious work is better than an hour
spent in “going through the motions” in a desultory
fashion. Pupils who are in any difficulty and wish for
special guidance are advised to go in for the 2s. 6d.
course of instruction by post which is given in connection
with “Physical Culture,” full particulars of which are
given in this book. As I have already said, I should
advise all pupils to use the “Grip” dumb-bell; then,
instead of buying a heavier pair of dumb-bells after the
exercises are being done a certain number of times, all
that will be necessary will be to use a stronger spring.
I do not advise pupils to keep on with the same weight
bells or the same spring too long; when the exercises
are done a very great number of times the work becomes
monotonous and there is a natural tendency to do it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
a mechanical manner. Roughly speaking, when it takes
much over half-an-hour to get through the whole series
it is desirable to begin again with heavier bells or
springs.</p>

<p>Parents who desire to see their little ones grow into
well-developed men and women may be advised to buy
their babies light wooden dumb-bells as playthings.
The exercises themselves, of course, should not be
attempted until the child has reached the age of six or
seven. Parents especially would do well to remember,
as has already been said, that the tables are only
intended as a guide, and they should exercise their own
discretion with regard to the weight of bells used by
their children, and the number of times the exercises
should be done. In some cases a girl or boy of ten
years may be so delicate as to have no more strength
than a more sturdy child two or three years younger; in
such cases the table for the younger child should be
adhered to. From that age onwards be guided in the
amount of practice by the tables. In order that every
reader may understand the exercises easily, the leading
muscles only are mentioned in the chart.</p>

<p>Pupils should guard against over-exertion; and, above
all things, should not exercise violently. It will be
found convenient to let each arm (not both arms) move
once in a second. Thus, for example, the time of ten
movements with each arm of the first exercise would be
twenty seconds. As a general rule, this time will be
found to give just the exercise that is needed. Faster
movements are not recommended for either young or
old. Be careful also not to jerk the movements.
Always exercise easily and gracefully, and when contracting
the muscles take care <i>not to hold the breath</i>.
Many pupils are inclined to do this unconsciously when
bringing their minds to bear upon the muscles, but it is
quite wrong, and the tendency must be striven against
until it is overcome. In one or two exercises, as will be
seen on the chart, there are special instructions with
regard to the breath; in all the others the breathing
should be perfectly natural.</p>

<p>When the <i>maximum</i> has been reached, the child should <i>continue</i>
to use the same weight bells and the same spring in the “Grip”
dumb-bell until it arrives at the age at which it can follow Table
No. 2, and so on with the other tables.</p>

<p>The reader of the second part of this book will see how
my professional career was thrust upon me. It came
through no seeking of my own, after my defeat of Samson.
I accepted it partly because the offers seemed too good to
be thrown away, and partly because they enabled me to
gratify a wish to see something of the world. My ambition,
however, was always to form and build up a system for
the service of others, rather than exhibit merely the results
of that system in my own person. That ambition, I hope,
is to be realised, for I have founded several schools of
training for men, women, and children of both sexes, and in
the course of time, I intend to establish branches in every
important town.</p>

<p>The schools are conducted entirely on my own system of
physical culture. Instruction is given by specially qualified
teachers, and every exercise is lucidly described and clearly
demonstrated. The pupils have every opportunity of
developing their bodies to the highest extent, and from
time to time I personally examine them.</p>

<p>The instructors employed in the school have been
specially trained for their work by me, so that the pupils
have the benefit of my best information, and of thus
learning the whole of my system exactly. In addition to
the classes for men, women, and children, arrangements are
made for giving private lessons when required.</p>

<p>My brother-in-law, Mr. Warwick Brookes, jun., is the
best pupil I have ever had. For the past six years he
has followed my system thoroughly, and the results have
been remarkable. When I first met him he was exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
delicate. He could only walk with the aid of crutches.
Gradually, however, he began to improve, and under my
personal supervision, by the help of my system, his strength
has so increased that to-day he is like a new man.</p>

<p>By means of the schools I hope to do something to substantially
aid the physical development of this and succeeding
generations. Letters from past pupils testify to the
great benefits which can be derived from careful training
under my system, and if the training has the further
advantage of individual instruction those benefits should be
increased even more than by studying this book.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant ambition to hope by one’s efforts to leave
the world just a little better here and there than one found
it; and that has always been and is my ambition. My
pupils can help me to realise it.</p>

<p>As I have said, I intend opening schools in every large
town in the country; at present schools are open at the
following addresses:—</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">London</span>:—32, St. James’s Street, S.W.</li>

<small>INSTRUCTION BY CORRESPONDENCE.</small></h3></div>


<p>None of my departments has shown a more gratifying
development than has the correspondence department.
Letters pour in from all parts of the world asking for
advice and instruction in such numbers that I have been
obliged to organise a special system and department for
dealing with the enquiries of my many friends, who, owing
to their living at a distance and to other reasons, cannot
attend the schools personally.</p>

<p>Every week many letters reach me from the Colonies
alone&mdash;from India, Canada, Australia, South Africa&mdash;even
from distant Klondike&mdash;and from one and all I have received
flattering testimonials as to the benefits they have derived
from following my instructions. This is an example:&mdash;Mr.
Dunbar, of Queensland, writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Mr. Sandow,</p>

<p>“I cannot express my gratitude for the wonderful benefit
I have derived from your three months’ course of instruction.
Previous to practising your system I was a chronic
dyspeptic, and owing to my sedentary occupation, for many
years I had not known what it was to feel the natural
exhilaration and energy of a healthy man. Now I honestly
believe that there is not a healthier man in the whole
Colony.”</p>
</div>

<p>One pleasing feature of this undertaking is the steady
increase in the number of applications from ladies. This
department has already become the most important part of
my work, and anyone wishing to keep in touch with my
system of Physical Culture can do so by forwarding to me
their measurements, sex, age, and occupation. In the case
of any physical peculiarity, or organic weakness, a doctor
should be consulted, and the result of his examination stated
in the letter of communication. A form is inserted at the
end of this book as a guide to those wishing to apply.
These forms are dealt with by myself and each case receives
my individual consideration and instruction, and is signed
by me.</p>

progressing. The chest should be measured both with the
lungs full of air and empty, as well as in its normal
condition.</p>

<small>THE COMBINED DEVELOPER.</small></h3></div>


<p>After considerable experience and exhaustive experiments
with rubber machines, I have succeeded in inventing one
which allows of a combination of dumb-bell and rubber
exercises.</p>

<p>Exclusive rubber exercise has not the effect of producing
hard, firm, and supple muscles, therefore I have patented
the detachable dumb-bell handles, which are simplicity itself.</p>

<p>This developer can be so regulated as to prove equally
beneficial to a weak man as to myself.</p>

<p>From an economic point of view it stands alone, as at a
small outlay a Developer can be purchased, which is
sufficient for a whole family, and constitutes an entire
athletic outfit.</p>

<p>The detachable rubbers and handles allow of the machine
to be fixed up to any tension, so that as one becomes
stronger, one has ample scope for gradually increasing one’s
strength. The fatal drawback to the ordinary rubber
exerciser is that it only proves beneficial up to a certain
point, and then it is not sufficient to carry one any
further. Consequently one has to make another outlay
in purchasing a heavier machine. My Developer has
been designed to obviate this, as it can be regulated up to
any strength.</p>

<p>The machine is simply made and easily fixed, causing no
damage to the door or wall to which it is attached. There
being no pulleys, no oiling is required, and there is no
friction to wear out the covering of the cords. Thus the
Developer is very durable.</p>

<p>Charts, illustrating Chest Expander, Dumb-bell and
Developer exercises, together with a pair of nickel-plated
dumb-bells, are given free with each machine. The dumb-bells
being detachable can be used separately for the
exercises as prescribed in this book. The exercises are
specially arranged by myself, introducing several of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
movements in my system of development which cannot be
properly executed on any other machine.</p>

<p>In the charts are included special exercises for strengthening
the legs; many pupils have found this very beneficial.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_041" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img  src="images/i_041.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">The above illustration shows the Developer as a Rubber Exerciser, Chest
Expander, and Dumb-bells.</div></div>

<p>The great value of the Developer lies in the fact that it
serves to render the muscles pliable, and the whole body
flexible and supple. Certain movements with it, too, are
difficult to perform satisfactorily with dumb-bells alone. I
recommend pupils to use the dumb-bells and complete
Developer alternately; by this means I find the most satisfactory
results are obtained. Exercise with the rubber Developer
affords a welcome change from work with the dumb-bells.</p>

<small>HEAVY WEIGHT-LIFTING.</small></h3></div>


<p>It is not my purpose in this book to give anything
beyond general directions for lifting heavy weights. You
can become thoroughly strong and enjoy perfect health by
means of the series of exercises already described. Heavy
weight-lifting requires personal instruction; that instruction
will be given to those who may desire it at my schools.
Under qualified instructors it may be pursued without the
risk of danger.</p>

<p>Generally, however, it may be observed that to lift heavy
weights it is desirable first to see what weight can be used
without undue strain. Slowly raise this weight from your
shoulder over your head, or, if from the ground, raise it somewhat
more quickly. See how many times you are able to raise
the weight first selected, and when you can perform the
exercise with comparative ease, raising it, say, ten times,
up to 80 lbs., six times from 80 to 100, and afterwards three
times, increase the weight for the next day’s exercise by five
pounds. Continue this increase as you grow more capable,
remembering always to bring the left hand into play as
well as the right; at the same time, though it should not
be neglected, avoid overtaxing the left side.</p>

<p>The great thing to remember is to go slowly. Avoid
anything like spasmodic efforts, and endeavour before
trying a lift to thoroughly think out the different movements.
Weight-lifting should never be practised in a
confined space or where the weight cannot be readily
dropped. To attempt to hold on to a weight after the
balance has been lost may result in serious strains and
other injuries; the pupil should practice dropping a
weight from any position safely and gracefully. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
pupil bear these few hints in mind he will come to no
harm, but, as I have said, weight-lifting is best left alone
until it can be practised under the personal supervision of
an experienced instructor.</p>

<p class="center">A PLEASING TRIBUTE.</p>

<p>The following letter was written me by Colonel Fox, late
Her Majesty’s Inspector of Army Gymnasia, a gentleman
to whom I am very greatly indebted for the interest he has
taken for years past in my work and for the zeal he has
shown in getting the system introduced into the British
Army:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
The Gymnasium. Aldershot.<br />
29th July, 1893.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Sandow,</p>

<p>I am in receipt of your letter from New York which reached
me on the 23rd instant, and am very glad to hear of your success
in America. The book you speak of as being about to be published
should also be very successful, and ought to do much
towards making your system of physical development widely
known.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Since your last visit to us here my Staff Instructors
and non-commissioned officers under training have been energetically
practicing the light dumb-bell exercises you so kindly showed
them.</p>

<p>I am convinced that your series of exercises are excellent and
most carefully thought out, with a comprehensive view to the
development of the body as a <i>whole</i>. Any man honestly following
out your clear and simple instructions could not fail to
enormously and rapidly improve his physique.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous for me to add that you yourself, in
<i>propria persona</i>, are the best possible advertisement of the merits
of your system of training and developing of the human body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Any individual gifted with a fair amount of determination, is
absolutely certain to develop his physical powers at an extraordinarily
rapid rate and with the most happy results to his
general health and mental powers and activity, by following with
intelligence your system. As you very rightly say, it is only by
bringing the brain to bear upon our exercises that we can hope
to produce the best results with the shortest possible expenditure
of time.</p>

<p>The absence of expensive and cumbrous apparatus is no small
recommendation of your system, and you are thoroughly in the
right when you assert that lasting muscular development, and
consequent strength, can be best produced by the constant and
energetic use of light dumb-bells, employed in a sound and
scientific manner.</p>

<p class="right">

<p><i>I have just completed a course of lessons at your
“School of Physical Culture,” from which I have derived
untold benefit. Through the greater part of last year I
was so ill that for some time it was feared I might go into
consumption. I was medically treated, and at length
permitted by my doctor to try what your exercises
would do.</i></p>

<p><i>I entered your School with weak heart, weak lungs,
digestion sadly impaired. After three lessons, with persistent
home work, I began very slowly to gain strength
and an appetite, and now, at the end of my course, I am
quite a new creature&mdash;full of vitality and energy.</i></p>

<p><i>The upper part of the lung, which was the chief cause
of my trouble, is quite healed and healthy. I never know
now what it is to feel pain and tightness in the bronchial
tubes, from which I constantly suffered in the past. My
digestive organs too are quite well.</i></p>

<p><i>I write these few lines to convey to you my
thanks and gratitude for the boon you have given me and
the public at large. I refer to your excellent book on
how to gain health, muscle, and strength.</i></p>

<p><i>I procured one about two years ago, and have studied
and practised the drills incessantly since. The result is
far beyond my expectations. I am nineteen years of age
and small of stature, being only five feet in height and
seven stone in weight, yet, without exaggeration, I can say
that my strength and muscular development would do
credit to a man six feet high.</i></p>

<p><i>I have gained this solely by your system and cannot
praise it too highly.</i></p>

<p><i>Another great advantage over other systems is the small
outlay required, as I have obtained for a few shillings all
that is necessary to train with, whereas if I had trained
under another system I should have had to have made a
much larger outlay for apparatus.</i></p>

<p><i>I enclose a list stating what I have gained in strength
and muscle since I started training.</i></p>

<p><i>It will always be a great pleasure to me to answer any
questions concerning your system, likewise interview
anyone who might be desirous of seeing me.</i></p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p><i>It is just over three years since I started to
improve my physical power by means of the Sandow system,
and I take this opportunity of forwarding some photographs
taken at different periods. In what measure I have
succeeded can best be seen by comparison of my original
efforts and my present attainments, of which I also
forward a list. Although they are as yet nothing to
boast about or sufficiently great to be handed down to
posterity, they are the result of close application to the
system Mr. Sandow originated, and by means of which,
in a few years, I hope to attain the culmination of human
strength, and, if possible, to rival that of Sandow himself,
for I am a firm believer in starting with an almost unattainable
ideal, then gradually coming within measurable
distance of it, and eventually, perhaps, to reach it. To do
this will require the exercise of many mental qualities,
determination, perseverance, and endurance. I suppose
there are many young men like myself in whom Mr. Sandow
has awakened a latent ambition to muscular prowess, and
in doing so I state without any hesitation that he alone has
done as much good for the country as any man of the present
century.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p><i>I can only conclude with expressing my deep gratitude
to Mr. Sandow for the splendid facilities he has offered
to those who wish to be classed as nature’s men (which is
indeed the duty of man), and in doing so I am but echoing
the sentiments of many of his pupils.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Peters is a fine weight-lifter, having accomplished
the splendid feat of raising 210lb from the floor to arms’
length above the head, <i>using one hand only</i>. This is
probably the amateur record. As he is only 23 years
old there is yet plenty of time for him to far eclipse even
this striking feat.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sandow</span>,</p>

<p><i>Not often is it given to us in this life to sow our
seed and gather in the full fruits of the same. Therefore
it is with more than ordinary pleasure that I write this
letter to say that with your system of Physical Culture
this extremely satisfactory result is to be obtained.</i></p>

<p><i>When first I joined your school some four or five months
ago I was a very fair average specimen of a young
Englishman (and our national thews and sinews are by no
means to be despised), but owing, in a great measure, I
suppose, to my city life, I had run a little to seed, and more
than once had required the aid of doctors and tonics. The
advice of the former invariably ended with the same
formula, “take more exercise.”</i></p>

<p><i>I was quite ready to agree with them, as during my
holidays in the country, when I was exercising in one form
or another nearly the whole day, I felt quite a different
man and as fit as possible.</i></p>

<p><i>But work in the city is a little difficult to reconcile with
plenty of exercise. Some time previously Mr. Sandow
had opened his school for Physical Culture, and having
often admired him and his feats from afar, I resolved to
go to him.</i></p>

<p><i>I am a business man, and from a business point of view
I never did a better stroke of business in my life.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p><i>I am a mortal being, and speaking from a human point
of view I never in my life came to a happier conclusion
than when I resolved to become a pupil of the School of
Physical Culture. I have increased in girth and weight
without scarcely a superfluous ounce of flesh.</i></p>

<p><i>My working capabilities and staying powers are all
doubled, and what before was an effort has now become a
pleasure. Indigestion, torpid lassitudes, rasped nerves,
and jaded appetite, are to me now unknown quantities.</i></p>

<p><i>With splendid appetite, long peaceful nights, and
wondrous powers of vigour and vitality, I can face the
world and with a deep sense of gratitude say, this is what
Mr. Sandow and his system of Physical Culture have done
for me.</i></p>

tested it fairly, as I must plead guilty to having done none

<p><i>After six months training as a pupil at your
School of Physical Culture (Manchester), I now feel
qualified to judge as to the merits of your system.</i></p>

<p><i>For the perfect and symmetrical development of the

dumb-bell and rubber exercises as taught and practised in
your gymnasia.</i></p>

<p><i>For the promotion of lost health, due to bodily neglect;
as a cure for insomnia, and many abdominal disorders, it
needs no recommendation.</i></p>

<p><i>Concerning my personal improvement, little need be
said, sufficient to say I never felt better in my life, and
recent weight-lifting tests have proved me to be possessed
of nearly double my former strength.</i></p>

<p><i>Nor has my speed or activity suffered in the least (which
so many, erroneously, consider to be the inevitable result
of such training). On the contrary, I feel as capable of
doing my 10⅖ for the 100 as ever I did.</i></p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p><i>Having been under your system for a little over
a year, I should like to add a few words in praise of your
system generally. I hardly think that actual figures as
to measurements and weight-lifting, give any adequate
idea of the general benefits received by anyone who takes
up Physical Culture thoroughly and puts his back into it.</i></p>

<p><i>If figures are any guide to you, however, I may quote
the following, which were all taken at your School in
Ebury Street.</i></p>

<p><i>My lung capacity has increased from 283 to 417 cubic
inches, my chest expansion from 39½ to 42¼, thigh from
20½ to 22⅝, and calf from 13⅞ to 15¼.</i></p>

<p><i>In weight-lifting I can raise 125 lbs. from the ground
with my right hand above head by means of the body-press,
instead of 60 lbs. With two hands I can jerk 165 lbs.
instead of 85 lbs., and I can hold out at arm’s length with
my right hand 45 lbs. instead of 20 lbs.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p><i>Your system has so generally benefited my whole
physique, however, that I consider my health has improved
to an extent far beyond any actual increase in figures.</i></p>

<p><i>One of the grandest benefits of Physical Culture is, to
my mind, the increase of will power and general
concentration, which can never be measured in any actual
way, but which is bound to appear in after life, in short
becomes an integral part of his character.</i></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sandow</span>,</p>

<p><i>I am glad to be able to say a few words about your
system of Physical Culture. I write feelingly, for I can
scarcely express how grateful I am for what it has done
for me. A few years back I became unpleasantly conscious
that a careless disregard for my health was beginning to
unfavourably affect my work before the British public.
Notwithstanding the indulgence shown me by audiences
in all the musical centres, I could not disguise from
myself the unpalatable fact that, as a result of neglecting
a cold and getting generally “run down,” my singing
voice was becoming seriously impaired. And so it remained
until chance led me to your school of Physical
Culture, and to renew the active bodily exercise which I
had dropped for so long. The result was eminently
satisfactory; I was soon once more able to fulfil my
public engagements with reasonable satisfaction to myself
and, I trust, some pleasure to my audiences. I entirely
attribute the return of my powers to the course I went
through on your system.</i></p>

<p><i>Actors and singers do not need great muscular
strength, but they do most emphatically require health,
and, of course, health and reasonable development go
together. No man is such a slave to his physical condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
as the actor or lyric artist. However great his talent, he
cannot give expression to it if the machine be out of
repair; his physical health is obviously his most valuable
asset. For this reason alone I am sure that every
member of my profession would be well advised to get into
the way of devoting a few minutes every day to your
exercises. The lyric artist especially would find his
voice improve, his spirits be more exuberant, and his
general vitality at a very much higher level. In addition
he would in most cases discover in a very short time that his
figure and limbs were so much improved that his former
expenditure upon lambs-wool tights, padding, &amp;c., would
be entirely obviated.</i></p>

<small>MY CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD.</small></h3></div>


<p>It is not necessary, as some may think, to be born strong
in order to become strong. Unlike the poet, who, we are
told, has to be born a poet, the strong man can make himself.
As a child, I was myself exceedingly delicate. More
than once, indeed, my life was despaired of. Until I was in
my tenth year I scarcely knew what strength was. Then
it happened that I saw it in bronze and stone. My father
took me with him to Italy, and in the art galleries of Rome
and Florence I was struck with admiration for the finely
developed forms of the sculptured figures of the athletes of
old. I remember asking my father if people were as well
developed in these modern times. He pointed out that they
were not, and explained that these were the figures of men
who lived when might was right, when men’s own arms
were their weapons, and often their lives depended upon their
physical strength. Moreover, they knew nothing of the
modern luxuries of civilization, and, besides their training
and exercise, their muscles, in the ordinary course of daily
life, were always being brought prominently into play.</p>

<p>The memory of these muscular figures were ever present,
and when we returned home to Konigsberg I wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
to become strong like them. But though I used to try my
strength and attend the gymnasium, nothing came of my
desire for some years.</p>

<p>So until I was eighteen I remained delicate. At that
age I began to study anatomy. It was thus I ascertained
the best means of developing the body, and invented the
system of giving each individual muscle a movement, and of
so arranging the form of the exercises that when some
muscles are brought into play others are relaxed and left
without strain.</p>

<p>About fifteen minutes every day was the average time
devoted to special exercise at this period. It may be useful
to remark here that no particular form of diet was adopted.
I ate and drank in the ordinary way. It may be said at
once that I have no belief in special diet; I have always
eaten and drunk that which my fancy dictated, but I have
always taken care to avoid anything in the nature of excess.
There is no better guide to good living than moderation.
That is a fact I am always anxious to impress upon my
pupils. Let them be moderate in all things, and they need
fear no interruption in gaining strength by my system of
training.</p>

<small>HOW I CAME TO LONDON AND DEFEATED
SAMSON.</small></h3></div>


<p>The years of my life between eighteen and twenty-one
may be passed over with the remark that they saw a steady
gain of strength and some occasional performances as an
amateur athlete and wrestler.</p>

<p>In 1889 I made the acquaintance of Aubrey Hunt, the
artist, who was then at Venice. One of the most charming
views in the neighbourhood was to be gained from the
grounds of my villa near Ledo. Naturally Mr. Hunt wished
to paint it, and it was a pleasure to be able to afford him
the facility. One result of our acquaintance was that Mr.
Hunt painted me in the character of a gladiator in the
Coliseum at Rome. This picture, which I prize very
highly, is to be seen in the reception room at my St.
James’ Street school. I am told that it is a very striking likeness.</p>

<p>It was from Mr. Hunt that I learned that Samson was
offering, at the Royal Aquarium in London, £100 to the
person who could perform the feats of his pupil, Cyclops,
and £1,000 to anyone who could beat his own. Mr. Hunt
suggested that I should accept the challenge, and it was
my original intention to come to London with him. It was
ultimately decided, however, that I should start without
delay, and the journey to England was made on the same
day that I first heard of the challenge.</p>

<p>Arriving in London at six o’clock in the evening, I went
to Mr. Attila, a friend whom I had previously met at
Brussels, to ask him to act as interpreter, for at that time
I was unable to speak English. Mr. Attila not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
promised his services, but gave me fresh hope by expressing
his assurance that everything that Samson and his pupil
could do I could accomplish easily.</p>

<p>We determined that the challenge should be accepted that
night. With Mr. Albert Fleming to act as agent, we went
at once to the Aquarium. When Samson appeared on the
stage he gave the usual challenge. Apparently to his
surprise, Mr. Fleming accepted it, asking him if he had the
£100 at hand. Samson replied that there would be no
difficulty about the money, but Mr. Fleming insisted on
seeing it, and the note was accordingly produced. Samson
was then asked if he had the £1,000 ready, and he promised
that it would be forthcoming in the event of the defeat of
his pupil.</p>

<p>The preliminary arrangements having been completed,
and the note for £100 handed to Captain Molesworth, the
manager of the Aquarium, I walked up to the stage. Seeing
me in evening dress, the audience were unable to realise
that I stood the slightest chance of defeating the strong
man and his pupil. They even shouted to Samson not to
heed me, but to get on with his performance. It seemed
evident to them that I was unequal to the task that had
been undertaken, and Samson himself burst out laughing
when he saw me. The coolness and indifference of this
first reception in London were not, perhaps, unnatural, for
in evening dress there was nothing, as everyone said at the
time, specially remarkable about my appearance. But
when I took off my coat, and the people could see the
muscular development, the tone of indifference changed
immediately to surprise and curiosity. Samson and
Cyclops themselves shared the general astonishment,
though they did not allow their surprise to be shown for
more than a moment, Samson being heard to remark, “We
will beat him, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The first feat which Cyclops performed was to lift over
his head two weights of 56 lbs. each, lowering them with
arms fully extended. This performance I repeated. Cyclops
next took the bar bell, weighing 240 lbs., and with two
hands lifted it from the ground over his head. When the
audience saw that for the second time the same feat could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
be accomplished with ease they began to cheer; and I repeated
the performance, after Cyclops, using only one hand.</p>

<p>All this time Samson, anxious of the issue, kept asking
me in asides in French to let him know my history. As,
however, he did not, or would not, speak in German, he had
to remain in ignorance.</p>

<p>The performance proceeded, and now Cyclops took with
one hand a dumb-bell weighing 210lbs., and extending it at
arm’s length, bent down and raised over his head with the
other a second dumb-bell, of 100lbs. weight.</p>

<p>When I repeated this feat, it was thought that the
challenge had been won, for this was the end of the performance
for which it was understood it was offered. Mr.
Fleming, accordingly, asked for the £100, but Samson
refused, saying that the whole performance would have
to be repeated and continued until one of the two
competitors gave in. Nothing less would satisfy him as
to which of the two was the stronger. On this point the
audience disagreed, and called on him to hand over the
money. Appeal was made to Captain Molesworth, who
addressing the audience, promised to see fair play. He
could not agree, he said, with Mr. Samson that it was fair
that the performance should be continued until one of them
dropped from sheer exhaustion, but he suggested that
Cyclops should introduce two fresh feats, and that if I
could repeat them the money should be mine without
further question.</p>

<p>Although the audience still maintained that the challenge
had been won, I expressed, through my interpreter, perfect
willingness to perform not two only, but twenty more feats,
should Cyclops wish to try them.</p>

<p>The first of the two extra feats was then taken: Cyclops
lying on his back, raised a weight of 240 lbs. with two men
sitting on it, and when the men jumped off he himself stood
up, raising the weight with him. This performance I also
repeated.</p>

<p>Now came the final effort. At the side of the stage
stood a great stone, weighing, I should think, about 500 lbs.
On this stone were secured the two 56lb. weights.
Two chairs were brought, and Cyclops, standing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
them, in order to get a position above the stone and its
weights, raised the whole load with his middle finger some
four inches above the ground.</p>

<p>When this performance had been repeated by me, Samson
acknowledged that that part of the challenge relating to
Cyclops had been won, and offered to hand over the
£100.</p>

<p>My interpreter then explained that I had not come to
London to win merely the £100; I had come for the
greater sum, the £1,000, in fact, which had been offered
to any person who should defeat Samson himself.</p>

<p>Samson, who was clearly surprised at the issue, replied
that he was not prepared to meet me that night, and
though the public disapproved of the postponement, it was
eventually decided with Captain Molesworth that the test
should be made on the following Saturday evening.</p>

<p>The eventful evening which was to decide the issue
between us fell on the 2nd of November, 1889. Never, it
was said, had the Royal Aquarium been so densely crowded.
The people began to arrive as early as two o’clock in the
afternoon. When I reached the building, in company with
Captain Molesworth, Mr. Attila, and Mr. Fleming, twenty
minutes before the hour announced for the challenge to be
taken up, it was literally impossible to get through the
crowd.</p>

<p>Here, at the very outset, was a difficulty of a new and an
unexpected character. What was to be done? To try to
get through the enormous throng in twenty minutes was
obviously hopeless. Willing as the crowd might be to let
us pass it was beyond their power to make way for us. We
determined, therefore, to go to the stage door, and here a
further difficulty presented itself. We could not gain
admission; no one would open the heavy door. The man
behind had received the strictest orders to prevent anyone
from entering. In vain did Captain Molesworth implore
him to let us through, explaining who we were. The man
was obdurate. He said that he was very sorry, but he
failed to recognise Captain Molesworth’s voice, and he could
not disobey explicit instructions.</p>

<p>All the time the precious minutes were flying, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
hour when the challenge was to be met had actually
arrived. It was, indeed, an anxious and a trying
moment. We heard afterwards that when the hour of the
challenge came and Samson saw that I was not there, he
strutted up and down the stage, exclaiming: “Ah! see, he
does not come! I thought he would not meet me. I will
give him five minutes, nay, ten minutes more.” He took
out his watch, the minutes were speeding, and still Samson
stood alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, resolved not to be baffled by this absurd mischance,
it was determined that, as fair words would not
open the door, strength should smash it open. A blow well
directed, and the door was burst from its hinges. The man
inside was slightly injured by this rough method, but a
ten pound note served to solace Ins feelings, and to heal his
wounds. And we&mdash;well, we just managed to save the
challenge by the space of half-a-minute.</p>

<p>The Marquís of Queensberry and Lord de Clifford were
appointed judges, and they examined closely all the bars,
bells, weights, and chains that were to be used in the performance.
Samson first desired that I should follow him in
some juggling feat with a water bottle, but the judges
decided that this was not in the order of the performance.
Only such tests of actual strength as Samson was in the
habit of displaying could now be allowed. Samson, abiding
by this decision, took a large iron bar and bent it over his
calf, his arms, and his neck, just as, in a similar way, by
striking it on the muscles of the arm, one may bend a
poker. The thing is little more than a trick. Of course,
muscle is essential to its successful performance; for if you
have no muscle you will hit the bone, with the danger of
breaking it. Such a performance, although there is a
certain knack in doing it gracefully, and with ease, was not
difficult to follow.</p>

<p>Samson next took a wire cable, winding it round his
chest, under his arms, and then breaking it. This feat,
which is performed by inflating the lungs and at the same
time contracting the muscles of the chest, I was also able to
repeat.</p>

<p>By the third item in the display it seemed that Samson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
desired to leave the issue of the challenge in doubt, for it
consisted in snapping a chain which encircled his arm.
This armlet, which fitted Samson well enough, was too small
for me. Fortunately I was prepared for the emergency.
I had ascertained where the chain was bought, and had got
the same firm to make me an armlet of exactly the same
strength, of a size suitable to my larger development.
When I produced it, Samson at first refused to be satisfied
that it would be a fair test, but a representative of the firm
who made it stood up in the auditorium and assured the
public that it was of the same strength as that of the chain
made for Samson. The judges examined it, together with
the paper which testified to the equality of strength, and
decided that the test would be perfectly fair and that the
performance was to continue. I placed the chain on my
arm and broke it.</p>

<p>Samson was still dissatisfied, and I made the offer that
if either he or his pupil, Cyclops, could repeat my performance
with a dumb-bell which I had at hand, we would
declare the result a draw, and he could keep his £1,000.
The dumb-bell, which was then brought on to the
stage, weighed 280lbs. With one hand I lifted it up, then
laid down, and finally stood up with it. After that feat I
fastened some chains round my arms, then took a dumb-bell
weighing 220lbs., raised it to my chest and burst the
chains before releasing it.</p>

<p>“I have had enough of this,” now exclaimed Samson.
“It’s all humbug, I don’t call this fair play at all.”</p>

<p>The judges, however, were sufficiently satisfied, and
Mr. Fleming asked for the £1,000. The reply was that
it should be paid in the morning, but it remains to
be added that I never received that £1,000. It was
stated that Samson had taken his money away, and in
the end I agreed to accept £350 from the management
of the Aquarium in settlement of the challenge.</p>

<p>When we left the Aquarium after the contest the great
crowd followed us cheering, and the four-wheeled cab into
which we got, was lifted up by these enthusiasts. The
crowd cheered us all the way to my rooms in Leicester-square;
newspaper men poured in to interview me; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
though I had then no intention of giving performances in
public, I was induced to accept one of numerous offers, of
£150 a week, made by a syndicate of the members of the
Lyric Club, and I commenced an engagement at the
Alhambra, giving Mr. Attila £30 a week to assist me.</p>

<p>I spent three months at the Alhambra, and three months
in the provinces, and entered into engagements for some
years to come.</p>

<p>The reader will probably ask if special means were
adopted during this and succeeding engagements to
maintain my strength. The answer is very simple: The
performance itself provides the necessary amount of daily
training. I eat, drink, smoke, and sleep quite in the
ordinary way, taking care to observe in all things that
guiding rule of moderation to which reference is made in
the preceding chapter. I only practice, in order that grace
and perfection may be attained, when some new feat is
introduced. Personally it may be added, I find that the best
time for a performance is about three hours after a meal.</p>

<small>I MEET GOLIATH.</small></h3></div>


<p>At the end of my first engagement in London and the
provinces, I went to Germany for a holiday. Driving out
one day at Aachen, I met a veritable giant. He was a
quarryman, and he was engaged in loading stones. So huge
and extraordinary was his appearance that my horse
positively shied at him.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, this tremendous fellow: his head as
huge and grotesque as that of any pantomime mask, with a
nose the size of an ordinary fist. As for his own fist, it
would have made more than three of mine, and when a five-shilling
piece was placed beneath the ball of his finger, believe
me, it was impossible to see it. So large were his boots
that not only could I get both my feet into one, but I could
turn entirely round inside. And yet, strangely enough,
despite his immense limbs and body, he was not an extraordinarily
tall man. A little more than six feet; six feet
two-and-a-half inches, in fact, was his height. His chest
measurement was about eighty inches and his weight
400lbs. He was not a fat man in proportion to his size.
Quite the contrary. He was bony and muscular.</p>

<p>The thought occurred to me as soon as I saw him that to
give him a part in a performance as a modern Goliath would
be, from a popular point of view, eminently attractive. I
asked him what wages he was earning. “Five marks a day,”
he replied. It appeared that he was given nearly double the
pay of an ordinary labourer because he could lift heavier
weights and load the carts more quickly. I told him that
if he liked to accept an engagement with me I would give
him twenty marks a day, whether he worked or not. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
German mark, as everyone knows, is equivalent to an
English shilling. The giant quarry man could scarcely
credit such good fortune, and eventually it was agreed that
he should come to my house to talk the proposal over, and
have his strength tested. When he came it was found that
he could do nothing more than lift heavy weights from the
floor. He had never put himself into training, and his
exceptional proportions, which, under different circumstances,
might have been turned to good account, were of
no special use to him. However, it was settled that he
should come with me, and I brought him to England.</p>

<p>Well do I remember our arrival at Charing Cross. The
huge size of Goliath, whose real name, by the way, was
Karl Westphal, attracted the most pronounced attention.
It was impossible to think of taking a cab, for no cab would
have held him, even if he had been able to get inside it.
There was, therefore, nothing for it but to walk to my
chambers, which were then in Rupert-street, Piccadilly.
Thousands of people followed us the whole way, and Rupert-street
was blocked. A giant, when you have got him, is
rather like a white elephant. He is a rare creature, but it
is difficult to know what to do with him. It would have
been clearly unwise to let him go into the streets, and
accordingly he had to be kept indoors. For seven or eight
weeks I tried to train him, but he proved an idle fellow,
and it became evident that nothing much could be done
with him.</p>

<p>I had an engagement at that time at the Royal Music
Hall, and a performance was arranged in which Goliath had
to surprise me, lumbering after me across the stage, and
trying to hold me in his grip.</p>

<p>We wrestled together, and it was his business to make
himself the victor. Then, in order to finish me, he took a
cannon, weighing 400lbs., and placing it on his broad
shoulders, prepared to fire. In a moment or so I returned
with the clubs. It was now the turn of the giant to show
alarm, and gradually he had to retire, with the cannon still
on his back, into a frame of refuge. I at once climbed to
the top, and getting into a position above my antagonist,
I lifted him, his refuge, and his cannon, with one finger, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
few inches off the ground. During this part of the performance
we fired the cannon, and the whole display
was brought to a conclusion by placing my arm through
a leathern belt which girt his waist, and carrying him
at arm’s length off the stage.</p>

<p>What became of him after he left me I never heard. The
last report was that he had carried off his own landlady,
and that the two had started some sort of show together.</p>

<small>A PRESENTATION UNDER CURIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.</small></h3></div>


<p>After my engagement at the Royal came a holiday in
Paris. It was there I met a very dear school friend, whom
I had not seen since I was about ten years of age. My
friend’s father was at this time German Consul at
Paris. The incident which followed our meeting will be
better explained by prefacing the story with the statement
that as boys we were great billiard players. We were continually
playing at each other’s houses, and, though we were
such mere lads, we could even beat our fathers at the game.
Nothing, therefore, was more natural than that, when we
met, my friend should ask me if I was still a good player.
As a matter of fact I was not in practice, but that did not
deter us from deciding to try our skill. So we went to
a room which he selected, and started a game. He did not
know then that I had made my strength a profession; he
was rather under the impression that I had followed my
father’s desire and studied medicine. However, the game
began, and, as we talked a good deal over old times and
spoke in German and played rather slowly, I suppose we
unconsciously annoyed a party of Frenchmen. At any rate
they made unfriendly remarks, and before we had finished
our game they marked on the slate that they had engaged
the table. Wishing to play again, we were not disposed
to give it up to people whose manner was
obviously offensive. As our right to continue was
disputed, the attendant was called, and it was pointed
out that, according to the regulations of the establishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
we were perfectly within our rights in playing a second
game. So we played on, and whilst we were joking and
laughing about old times they, it seems, thought we were
making fun of their discomfiture.</p>

<p>When the game was finished we ordered two steaks,
which were served at a table behind the players. We were
still laughing over old times when one of the party came up,
saying angrily, “I’ve had enough of your laughter; if you
don’t stop be sure I’ll make you.”</p>

<p>I told him that I was very sorry that my mood offended
him, and if I could not laugh at our own personal jokes
I should be sorrier still. It was added that I did not wish
to interfere with him, and it was suggested also that he
should attend to his own game and leave us alone.</p>

<p>It was evident that he wished to pick a quarrel. Nor
would hot words suffice him. Vowing that he must give
me something to remember him by, he struck me across the
face. Beneath this fresh insult I tried to remain quite calm,
telling my assailant that it would be certainly better for
him to take himself off and leave me alone. But at such
times, when the temper is quick, good advice is not heeded;
moreover, he probably thought he had to deal with some
one of poor spirit.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been in his mind the facts are plain:
finding that I took one blow calmly he struck me another
and called me coward. My friend, who had hitherto kept
quiet, now attempted to interfere, but I held him down,
nearly wrenching his wrist round. The force which was
exerted must have given him an idea of the strength that
was ready to be used if it were needed, for looking first at
his wrist and then at me, he exclaimed in English, “Why
don’t you knock the fellow down?”</p>

<p>“So you speak English,” said the Frenchmen, “Why
don’t you get up and fight me?” With these words he
struck me fiercely on the nose. The blood streamed down my
clothes, which were spoilt besides by the gravy that was
splashed on them in the disturbance from the dishes. My
appearance must have been deplorable, and as I was that
morning wearing a new suit, I lost my patience with the man.
I walked slowly towards him, and with a quick grip of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
his neck and knees, I picked him up, knocked his head and
knees together, and banged him down in the centre of the
table. The table broke through, and he fell to the ground.
You can imagine, I daresay, the scene of wreckage and consternation&mdash;the
smashed table, the man dazed, lying in a
heap on the floor, his friends around him open-mouthed with
amazement. In the midst of this scene I sat down with my
friend and smoked a cigar.</p>

<p>A gendarme was fetched. He entered the room and
wanted to arrest me. The proprietor caught hold of him,
saying, “Be careful, he is an awful man, he will kill you.
You must have some assistance.” Four more gendarmes
were summoned, and, refusing to take me in a cab, they
marched me along to the police station. Some of the
friends of the man who was hurt accompanied us and
explained to the authorities that the regrettable affair was
not my fault. They were sorry at what had happened, and
I was liberated on bail.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they took their injured comrade to the hospital.
He was still unconscious, and in that condition he remained
a day and a half. Being sincerely sorry for the injury I had
caused, I called at the hospital and asked to see him, but he
refused.</p>

<p>As soon as he recovered, which was not for some weeks, I
left Paris to return to London to fulfil an engagement at the
Tivoli.</p>

<p>One night, whilst I was performing there, the porter
brought me a message asking if I would step up to see a
gentleman and a party of friends in a private box. When I
went up I seemed to recognise the face of the person who
wished to see me, but I could not recall where I had seen it
before. The party invited me to take wine with them, and
nothing would satisfy them but my consent to be their
guest at supper.</p>

<p>When we reached the hotel, my host said: “I perceive,
Mr. Sandow, you have only pretended that you know me.
You do not really recall my identity.”</p>

<p>It had to be confessed that he was right.</p>

<p>“If you really knew me,” he proceeded, “you would
probably not speak to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” I asked. “I speak to you because I seem
to like you, surely that is sufficient.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” he added; “I have come a long way to see
you. I have come from Paris. I am an amateur in your
own line, performing feats of strength myself. Of all my
friends I have the reputation of being the strongest. Having
read of your performances in the French and English papers,
I was determined to come to London to see you. I saw the
whole programme at the Tivoli to-night, waiting impatiently
for your display. When you stepped on to the stage I nearly
dropped to the ground.”</p>

<p>“Why!” I asked, growing curious.</p>

<p>Tears stood in his eyes, as he exclaimed earnestly, “Will
you promise to forgive me, promise me that or I cannot tell
you.”</p>

<p>I told him that I did not know what I had to forgive, but
at any rate I promised to forgive him in advance.</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on, “if I had known you were Mr.
Sandow I would never have struck you that blow in Paris;”
and then in enthusiastic French fashion he clung hold of me
and kissed me on the cheek&mdash;on the cheek that he had
previously smacked&mdash;before all the people.</p>

<p>Of course, why had I been so blind? This was my assailant
of the French billiard room. All, however, was now
forgiven and forgotten, and as a token of our good understanding
he presented me with a handsome gold watch.
To-day we are the greatest friends, and, whenever I go to
Paris, I stay with him. He is a French Count, but for
obvious reasons, not the least being that he is my friend,
despite the hard knocks which came of our first meeting,
it would not be fair to disclose his name.</p>

<small>THE LIVING WEIGHTS.</small></h3></div>


<p>About this time there were many strong men. Each hall
in London could boast of at least one. It was also a great
weight lifting period. When I lifted my heaviest bell,
280lbs., the other strong men put out a placard stating that
they were lifting 300lbs. By the time I had practised
sufficiently to raise the weights I was lifting from 280lbs. to
300lbs., they came out with the statement that they were
lifting 320lbs., and so their little game went on.</p>

<p>For my part I was determined to introduce a novelty.
Henceforth, there should be actually living weights. I
started, therefore, at the Tivoli with a new display, lifting a
horse at arm’s length above my head, and marching
with it to musical accompaniment.</p>

<p>This was followed by a display with human dumb-bells.
Taking a long bar with a large ball at each end, I placed in
each ball a man, and I raised bar, balls, and men, slowly
over the head. After putting them down the balls opened
and the men rolled out. This performance I accomplished
in order to equal the feat of lifting 300lbs. dead weight.</p>

<p>Further, I lifted, and supported on my chest, a grand
pianoforte, with an orchestra of eight performers on top of
the instrument.</p>

<p>There was still a fourth feat which I performed, knowing
that no one could equal it, and that was to turn a somersault
whilst holding a weight of 56lbs. in each hand.</p>

<p>These performances I repeated in the provinces. During
this tour I had the pleasure of visiting not only many of the
chief cities of England, but also Edinburgh and Glasgow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Who can fail to be deeply impressed by the grandeur and
magnificence of the scenery of Scotland? Certainly I was
not proof against it. Never have I visited a more
beautiful city than Edinburgh, and the Scottish people
themselves I found exceedingly kind and agreeable. Since
then, I have been to Ireland, and can testify that its people
are as frank, generous, and warm-hearted, as they are always
represented to be. Certainly, some of the happiest days of
my life were those spent in the Emerald Isle.</p>

<p>At the end of my first provincial tour I returned to
London to fulfil an engagement at the Palace Theatre.
Here I introduced another novelty. In place of the orchestra
I held three horses on my chest. These animals stood
on a plank, one at each side and the third in the centre,
holding the balance in a game of see-saw. Included in this
performance was the feat in which a Horse Guardsman on
his horse rode over me, thus completing at that time the
chapter of living weights.</p>

<small>ON THE “ELBE”: BOUND FOR NEW YORK.</small></h3></div>


<p>We come now to the year of the Chicago Exhibition,when
I entered into a contract for an engagement in America,
with Messrs Abbey, Scheffel, and Grau.</p>

<p>An old friend and famous pianist, Martinus Sieveking,
whom I knew years before in Belgium and Holland, accompanied
me to the New World. Sieveking was a brilliant
artist, but as a man he was exceedingly weak and delicate.
He had no powers of endurance, and it was difficult for him
to remain at the piano long at a time.</p>

<p>“If I had only your strength,” he used to say, “I think
I might become almost the greatest player in the world.”</p>

<p>I suggested that he should come with me as my guest to
America, guaranteeing that in nine months or a year,
under my personal supervision and training, he would grow
so strong that his best friends would scarcely recognise
him.</p>

<p>Agreeing to come, he travelled with me all through
America. The result of my system and supervision was
that his strength grew marvellously. Within the year,
weak as he was at the start, he became the strongest of all
my pupils, and the most redoubtable amateur I have ever
met. The portrait, which is printed on an earlier page
will speak for itself when you remember that a year before
it was taken the sitter had a gaunt, slim, delicate figure,
with narrow chest, sloping shoulders, and no muscles worth
speaking about.</p>

<p>But I am going ahead too fast. Let us revert for a moment
to our departure from England. We sailed on the Elbe, the
vessel that was afterwards wrecked. There was a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of bustle in getting on board, and some curiosity, I suppose,
amongst the passengers, when they saw the sailors straining
beneath the weight of my luggage and apparatus, and got
to know that a strong man was to sail with them. With the
captain and the first engineer I became very friendly,
giving them, during the voyage, lessons in my system.</p>

<p>Somehow I used to feel that the ship we were on was a
doomed vessel. I am not ordinarily superstitious, and it is
not necessary to attempt to account for the feeling, but do
what I would I could not shake off the dread impression that
one day that ship would go down. I became so friendly
with the engineer, whom I used to visit in his own cabin,
that I advised him to give up his appointment and go to sea
no more.</p>

<p>Some time after that, whilst I was in America, the world
was startled by the news of the Elbe’s disaster. My friend,
the engineer, was amongst the few who were saved. He
wrote me a letter telling me of the tidings. This letter
touched me very deeply,and, seeing that it contains a story of
singular bravery, it may not be inappropriate if I introduce
here so much of it as I remember.</p>

<p>Having commented on the strange fulfilment of my prediction,
he described how, when the boat was going down, the
captain lashed himself to the bridge, saying he would never
leave his ship. From the engineer’s boat they called to him to
come on, but he would not stir. Then they sent back the
pilot, but still to no purpose. By the faint glimmer of a
lantern he pencilled a note which he asked might be sent,
if the bearer should be saved, with his heart’s love to his
dear wife and children. For the last time the pilot left the
ship, and as the boat bore away from its now fast sinking
sides the captain from the bridge, immovable from the post
of duty, waved his long farewell.</p>

<small>MY FIRST HOUR IN AMERICA.</small></h3></div>


<p>First experiences are occasionally curious. You shall hear
one of mine.</p>

<p>Although the day we reached New York was the hottest
that had ever been known in that great country of wonderful
records, no heat, however extreme, could detract from
the glories of New York Harbour, certainly the finest
harbour I have ever seen. Numerous people, including, of
course, the ubiquitous newspaper men, came on board to
welcome me, bands were playing, and there was a gay and
busy time generally.</p>

<p>Having landed, I entered a cab. Everyone, I suppose,
has a vivid recollection of his first cab in America. The
independence of the American cab-driver is sublime. It is
something too great for words. You can only draw a long
breath&mdash;and admire it. The particular journey which I was
undertaking would have been in England something considerably
less than a shilling fare. Hoping to be generous
I proffered the driver an equivalent in English money to two
shillings. To my surprise he said, “I guess, Colonel, that’s
for myself; your fare is four dollars”&mdash;just eight times as
much as I had offered. Of course, I could not argue with
the man. He knew better than I, and there was nothing
for it but to pay promptly what he demanded. Moreover,
in America, it must be remembered, they charge, not for the
drive, but for the cab.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbey, who met me on the boat, accompanied me to
the hotel at which I was to stay. At the office his attention
was called away for a moment, and I was left to the tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
mercies of the bell boy, a nigger, who was asked to show me
the rooms.</p>

<p>“Come along, sir,” the boy drawled. And along I went,
making my first acquaintance with an American elevator, in
which we were shot up heavenwards.</p>

<p>“How high are we?” I asked, as we got out.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is the sixteenth floor,” replied the boy, in an off-hand
manner, “you can see if you look down.” I did look
down. By Jove, the depth down that staircase was tremendous.</p>

<p>Having selected my apartments, the boy coolly stood
beside me in my own room rolling a cigarette and lighting
it in my presence. This action seemed a little impudent,
but it was nothing to that which was to come. Remarking
that I desired to wash, I also asked the boy if he would
clean my boots.</p>

<p>“Clean your boots?” he exclaimed, in blank astonishment,
“we don’t do that in America, we (speaking of course for
himself and the niggers like him) don’t clean boots here.”</p>

<p>“Who then,” I asked, “does clean them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must go down stairs for that.” And with these
words he reclined on my sofa, rolled another cigarette, and
calmly smiled at me.</p>

<p>This was really too much for white flesh and blood to bear.
I said to him sharply, “Look here, young man; I may be a
stranger in this country and ignorant of some of its ways,
but I know enough of Americans to be quite sure that it is
not right for you to conduct yourself in this way. If you
don’t promptly clear off I will report you!”</p>

<p>But the boy was not easily to be moved. Instead of
taking himself off he squared up and wanted to fight me.
So I just took hold of that boy, and testing his jacket and
trousers to be sure that they would bear the strain, I swung
him over the sixteenth floor staircase. And there for a few
moments I held him, just to give him a view of the depth,
which was so tremendous.</p>

<p>My word, didn’t that boy shout and scream! I assured
him that he was quite safe in my hand so long as it was
closed, but if he ever attempted his impertinences again I
would bring him to the same spot and open it. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
I reminded him that a drop through sixteen floors would not
be good even for nigger boys who smoked cigarettes in
private rooms and affected to be indignant at the suggestion
that they should clean a visitor’s boots.</p>

<p>The boy’s cries drew a small crowd, including Martinus
Sieveking and the manager of the hotel. The manager
fully agreed with the warning I gave the boy, and was
profuse in his apologies, saying that such conduct from a
bell boy was unprecedented.</p>

<small>INCIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN TOUR</small></h3></div>


<p>A fortnight after my arrival in New York I commenced
an engagement at the Casino, and after each performance,
whilst I was still stripped to the waist, I gave lecture on
anatomy and my system of physical culture in my dressing-room.
These lectures were attended by many of the most
notable people in America, the crowded audiences including
several ladies. I demonstrated how each feat was accomplished,
and let the people feel for themselves my muscles,
to prove that whilst, when they were relaxed they were as
soft as butter, when contracted they were as hard as
steel.</p>

<p>I repeated at the Casino the performances that I had
been giving at the Palace Theatre in London. As my
engagement lengthened I grew better acquainted with
the American people, whom, let it frankly be admitted,
I liked immensely. They are wonderfully nice fellows,
these Americans. The only fault that is to be found
with them is the too generous length to which their
hospitality is liable to go in the direction of cock-tails.
They like to give you a bath of cock-tails, and if a bath
should not suffice, they would think nothing of making
a river for you. For a moderate drinker like myself, their
generosity is a little embarrassing, but as the point was
emphasised that I could never have the assurance to say
that I had been to America without tasting a cock-tail, I at
last yielded to their persuasions, and, judging from the samples
of Manhattan, Martini, and Oyster, which I tried, I am
hound to confess that these drinks are exceedingly nice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
that there is little to beat them. Another striking feature
of life in America is to be found in the trotting horses.
They are simply marvellous creatures, moving with the ease
and almost with the speed of a railway engine.</p>

<p>From New York I went to Boston, where my system of
physical training became very fashionable; and after the
Boston visit came Chicago, Mr. Sieveking always accompanying
me.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Chicago I went to the Trocadero,
where I was to appear, and inquired for the manager. A
tall slim fellow made his appearance in answer to the
inquiry, and for some minutes a game of cross purposes
ensued. For whilst I was not sure whether he really was
the manager, he doubted whether I was the strong man
whom he expected. At last, however, I ascertained that he
was Mr. Ziegfeld, or at least Mr. Ziegfeld’s son, and he was
assured that I was Sandow. He showed me round the
theatre, which was a tremendous place, with accommodation
for fully six thousand people. It had been originally
an armoury, and was used more for concerts than variety
entertainments. Mr. Ziegfeld had taken it because his other
theatre, two days before the opening of the exhibition, was
burned down. At the time of my arrival it was proving too
big, but, as good luck would have it, such was the popularity
of my performances, the building, despite its huge size,
was filled nightly.</p>

<p>In the exhibition grounds one morning shortly after my
arrival, Mr. Ziegfeld suggested that I should drive round in
one of the hand wagons.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” I said, “it would never do for a strong
man to be pushed round like that, what would the people
say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they don’t know you yet,” replied Mr. Ziegfeld,
“you get in and try it.”</p>

<p>It was no use for me to chaff him by saying that these
wagons were more suitable for idle fellows of his slim proportions,
for inside he would have me get. Who of all
people in the world should come to push me round but an
unfortunate hunchback! The result was that next morning
the papers came out with illustrations of the ludicrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
scene, with the heading “The strong man too strong to
walk.”</p>

<p>At the termination of the World’s Fair, Mr. Ziegfeld
proposed that I should prolong my tour. I accepted his
suggestion, engaged him as my manager, and he booked
a tour for me, including all the principal cities. Throughout
this tour I offered at each performance ten thousand dollars
to any person who could duplicate my feats of strength or
even do anything that could be said reasonably to approach
them.</p>

<p>At St. Louis, one of the greatest beer brewing districts in
the world, the challenge, I was informed, was to be accepted.
The youth who was prepared to meet me, explained that he
was somewhat too stiff to accomplish all my feats, and I
accordingly promised that if he could repeat one of them, that
was to lift with one hand over his head my heaviest dumb-bell
weighing 300lbs., I would consent to give him the
money.</p>

<p>When the time came for him to take up the challenge, he
grew alarmed at the prospect. In answer to my manager’s
announcement from the stage that we were ready for him,
and that the money had been duly deposited, he stood up
in the auditorium to remark that the challenge was made
only as an advertisement, he did not believe in it, and he
refused to come to the stage. With these words he rushed
out of the building. His friends, who had a good deal of faith
in his physical powers, rushed after him, and succeeded in
bringing him back. In order further to encourage his drooping
spirits my manager offered him the ten thousand dollars
if he would lift the weight over his head with both hands.
But still he did not like to attempt the task he had
before rashly undertaken. We then reduced the conditions
still further, promising that if he would lift the weight with
two hands even as high as his shoulders we would still give
him the money. His friends now chaffed and now rallied
him, and at last he put his strength to the test; but lo, this
vaunted strong man was a very weak man, for so far from
being able to raise the weight to his shoulders, he succeeded
scarcely in moving it from the ground.</p>

<small>MY LION FIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO.</small></h3></div>


<p>Perhaps the greatest, certainly the most thrilling, of all
my experiences is that which I am about to relate. It is
the story of my lion fight in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I was performing in that western city at the time of the
mid-winter fair, which followed the Chicago Exhibition. In
connection with this fair Colonel Bone was exhibiting a great
menagerie. One day he advertised a fight to the death
between a lion and a bear. A tremendous tent, with accommodation
for twenty thousand people, was erected for the
occasion. Thousands and thousands of persons had bought
tickets, when the police issued an order forbidding the performance,
and the proposed spectacle had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The thought occurred to me that I should take the bear’s
place, and measure my strength against the king of the
forests. Of course there is always between the unarmed
man and the beast this disadvantage, that the beast has
natural weapons in his teeth and claws, whilst a man has
nothing to help him in the fight. This lion, moreover, was
a particularly furious animal. Only a week before he
made a meal of his keeper. I have met many lions in
various places, and this beast was certainly the largest
and finest of them all. I was fully prepared to meet him as
he was, provided I could have an equivalent for his claws in
a short dagger or some similar weapon; but the law in
America, as in England, is rightly very stern against cruelty
to animals, and the dagger, of course, could not be allowed.
If I desired to meet the beast the only way was to fight him
as I would box a man, completely unarmed. As there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
law to prevent cruelty to men, there was no objection to this
method, though Colonel Bone, as well as my own friends,
insisted that if there was to be a fight it must be a struggle
between brute strength and human strength. In short,
mittens would have to be placed on the lion’s feet to prevent
him from tearing me to pieces with his claws, and a muzzle
would have to be placed over his head. Even with these
precautions I was advised not to proceed with the contest.
“With his strength,” said Colonel Bone, “he’ll knock your
head off.” But, personally, I had no fear, I was only anxious
for the contest to begin. The engagement was accordingly
made, and “A lion fight with Sandow” was boldly advertised.
The announcement sent a thrill through the
cities for hundreds of miles around, and in order fully to be
equipped for a performance which would be bound to attract
thousands and thousands of people, I decided to rehearse my
fight with the lion beforehand.</p>

<p>Accordingly, preparations were made, and with much
difficulty the lion was mittened and muzzled. It took
several men with lassos and chains some hours to perform
this operation, for not only had they to guard against the
animal’s overpowering strength, but they had to proceed
cautiously in order not to injure him. A great cage,
measuring seventy feet across, was brought round, and into
it Colonel Bone, one of the most experienced of lion tamers,
let the animal enter. Few people were present, but amongst
them was my manager, that tall, slim, great, little Ziegfeld,
with a face white as snow. There is no doubt that Mr.
Ziegfeld and the small company felt the position acutely, for,
though personally I had confidence in myself&mdash;and confidence
of victory is always half a battle won&mdash;yet those around
were by no means sure of the issue, and there was some fear
that my first fight with a lion might be my last.</p>

<p>However, my purpose being fixed, I entered the cage,
unarmed and stripped to the waist. The lion, with fury in
his eyes, crouched down ready to spring. Having read a
good deal of the methods of the lion I was not unprepared
for this form of attack. As he made his last strain for a
tremendous leap I stepped sharply to the side and he missed
his mark. Turning quickly before he had time fully to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
recover, I caught him round the throat with my left arm,
and round the middle with my right. By this means,
though his weight was 530lbs., I lifted him as high as my
shoulder, gave him a good hug to assure him that it was
necessary to respect me, and tossed him on to the floor.</p>

<p>Thus outdone at his first attempt, the lion roared with
rage. Rushing fiercely towards me he raised his huge paw
to strike a heavy blow at my head. For the moment,
feeling the swish of the lion’s paw as it passed my face, I
really thought that Colonel Bone’s remark that he would
knock my head off would prove true. Luckily I dodged my
head just in time, and got a good grip round the lion’s body,
with my chest touching his and his feet over my shoulders.
Now came the tussle; the more I hugged him the more he
scratched and tore, and, though his feet were mittened, he
tore through my tights and parts of my skin. But I had
got him as in a vice, and his efforts to get away were fruitless.
Choosing an opportune moment, I flung him off me,
Colonel Bone and my manager shouting to me to come out
of the cage, as I had done enough, and the lion’s rage was
unbounded.</p>

<p>I was determined, however, before I left to try just one
other feat. Moving away from the lion, I stood with my
back towards him, thus inviting him to jump on me. I had
not to wait many moments. He sprang right on my back.
Throwing up my arms I gripped his head, then caught him
firmly by the neck, and in one motion, shot him clean over
my own head to the ground before me. Colonel Bone
rushed into the cage, snapping two revolvers to keep the
lion off, and I came out, my legs torn, my neck bleeding,
and with scratches all over my body; but I felt that I had
mastered that lion, and that I should have little difficulty in
mastering him again at the performance that was to be
given next day in public.</p>

<p>When the hour for the fight came, the huge tent which
held twenty thousand people was literally packed in every
part. The cage with the lion was outside, and whilst he
was being mittened and muzzled he became so furious that
he broke two iron chains that bound him, and got loose.
The people shrieked, the very men who a moment before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
had been boasting of their bravery, were the first to fly, and
there was a general stampede. But the moment the lion saw
my eyes fixed fearlessly and firmly on him he seemed paralysed.
Colonel Bone came up and pulled out his revolver, telling
me not to take my eyes off him, as I had him in my power.
Whilst we both remained motionless, the cage was brought
near his head, and by a dexterous movement I had him over
on his back, and once more he was a prisoner. The keepers
tried again to mitten him, and after a great struggle they
succeeded.</p>

<p>Then came the scene in the arena. The lion appeared first,
and as I entered the whole place shook with cheers and
applause. Through the whole of that vast assembly ran a
thrill of great excitement, and photographers were there ready
to take instantaneous pictures of the various positions of the
fight with the lion. But no sooner did I enter the cage
than the animal cowered down. He knew that I was his
master: and he refused to fight. Feeling that the audience
would be sadly disappointed, I tried to goad him on, but
nothing would move him. Most beasts are cowards at heart,
and this lion having met his match at the rehearsal, refused
to budge.</p>

<p>At last I caught hold of his tail and twisted it. This was
the only thing that moved him. As he made a bound
towards me I dodged, swung round and picked him up, and
then tossed him down. The fight lasted scarcely two
minutes. The lion, recognising that my strength was too
much for him, would fight no more. Though I lifted him
up and walked round the arena with him on my shoulders
he remained as firm as a rock and as quiet as a lamb. The
fierce fight at the rehearsal had subdued his courage. He
was clearly conquered. I was afraid that my audience
would be disappointed with the comparative tameness of
the proceedings, but, on the contrary, everyone seemed
thoroughly satisfied, and “the lion fight with Sandow” was
long the talk of the day in San Francisco.</p>

<small>FURTHER INCIDENTS OF THE TOUR.</small></h3></div>


<p>At the end of my engagement in San Francisco I organised
my own company for a holiday tour in California. What a
lovely country is that; a country of perpetual summer and
blue sky, of bright flowers and delicious breezes. Well do I
remember our arrival in Los Angeles. Thousands and thousands
of people came to meet our coach, the children
smothering us with roses as though it were some battle of
flowers.</p>

<p>But, of course, there were rough journeys in America as
well as pleasant ones. On the way to Omaha, for example,
we had an experience of the wilds. At the small villages at
which the train stopped it seemed to be the custom to
adjourn for the fifteen or twenty minutes to the gambling
dens that adjoin the stations. Gambling has never had any
attraction for me personally, but “In Rome one does as
Rome does;” and so in America. Accordingly, we visited
one of these gambling houses. There is no question about
the gambling. You play with dice. Everything is conducted
at lightning speed, and before you know where you
are high stakes have been lost or won&mdash;usually, it may be
said, they are lost. In our case we started, in the few
minutes at our disposal, by winning a good deal. Then we
lost, and we left that place with our pockets practically
empty. I had lost three hundred dollars, another lost four
hundred, and a third eight hundred.</p>

<p>During the next part of the journey we heard that there
was another gambling house at the station at which we
should stop on our way. It was in connection, we understood,
with that at which we had just lost our money, and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
doubt the manager would be informed by telegram of the
easy manner in which we had been duped, in order to be
prepared for our arrival. But we were determined to be
even with those gambling house keepers. We agreed at the
start not to risk more than five dollars, and if we won we
would depart with our winnings before the luck, as in the
last case, set in against us. For once expectations were
realised. Precisely the same thing happened. At the
beginning we had all the luck; we not only recovered what
we had previously lost, but each of us had a few hundred
dollars to the good. Then of a sudden our luck began to
turn. That was the signal. There was six or seven minutes
to spare before the train started, and the manager and his
friends said “You have lots of time, gentlemen, they will
tell you when the train’s ready.” Much to their astonishment,
however, we insisted on leaving, and as we walked out
with our pockets fairly full the faces of those men were a
study. I think on this occasion we had turned the tables
successfully.</p>

<small>MY DOG SULTAN. END OF THE TOUR.</small></h3></div>


<p>At this stage of the tour I will introduce, with the
reader’s permission, my dog Sultan, the holder of seventeen
first prizes. This dog, a handsome boar-hound, standing
about thirty-four inches high at the shoulders and weighing
some two hundred pounds, had been presented to me as a
puppy by Prince Bismarck. Though I have never specially
trained him, the dog has remarkable intelligence. My companion
throughout my tour in America, he used to jump
into the luggage van at every journey’s end to find my
trunks, and those that were not too heavy for him to lift, he
would bring out of the van. A similar performance would
be repeated when we reached the hotel. Sultan would himself
carry a good deal of the luggage upstairs, taking it up
piece by piece, and disdaining the assistance of the niggers
who would sometimes offer to give him help. Not unnaturally,
he became a great favourite wherever we went, and,
though it was against the regulations, the hotel managers
would allow us to have him in our rooms. He would never
go out without carrying a satchel containing his chain and
muzzle, a box of pills, two brushes, a tooth brush, a comb,
and a few pieces of flannel, which were used for rubbing him
down and keeping his coat in careful condition. He seemed
to know perfectly each of these contents, and if one was ever
missing he would not be satisfied until it was found or replaced.</p>

<p>Sultan can carry me very easily. Once in America I
sprained my foot. I happened to be staying at the time at
about the only hotel in the country which is not furnished
with elevators. My rooms were on the second floor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
that faithful and devoted creature would carry me up and
down stairs before and after each performance, for I was
still able to fulfil my engagements despite the sprain.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar thing about Sultan that, though he will
not hurt you, yet if you enter a room whilst he is in it
alone he will never let you leave until someone has attended
to you. As a thief catcher, he is, for this reason, unequalled.
On one occasion, as you shall hear, during my American
tour, he saved my watch&mdash;that watch which was presented
to me by my friend the French count. Whilst I am at the
theatre I usually leave my coat and vest hanging on the
wall of my dressing-room, Sultan being left in charge. One
night we missed for more than an hour one of the stage
assistants. When I returned to my dressing-room I was
unable for the moment to enter. Sultan, it appeared, was
blocking the door. Pushing it open I found the missing
assistant at the other end of the room in a state
of some uneasiness. I asked him what he was doing,
and he explained that he had come to see if he could offer
me any assistance. Having entered the room, the dog
would not let him move, and altogether he made out such a
piteous tale that I sent him off with half-a-dollar. When,
however, I came to look at my things I found that my
watch, instead of being where I left it, in my vest pocket,
was lying on the table, together with some money which had
been taken from my pockets. It was then clear that the
man’s real object in entering my room was not that of
assistance, but of robbery. I called him back, verified my
suspicions, and had him immediately discharged. For that
night’s work we treated Sultan to a special steak for his
supper.</p>

<p>This unfortunately was not the only adventure which I
had with this watch of which I was so proud. My friend’s
gift seemed to be doomed. Whilst we were at Omaha there
was a ball given in the city, and Mrs. Sandow and I were
invited to be present. As we should be late in returning I
told my valet to give Sultan his walk and then to take the
dog home with him for the night. We reached home about
half-past two in the morning, and being tired we went
straight to bed. It may be explained that our bedroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
stood behind the drawing-room, from which it was entered.
Beyond the bedroom was the bathroom, in which I hung
my clothes, leaving my watch and chain in my vest
pocket.</p>

<p>I felt that night, as I felt on the “Elbe,” that something
was going to happen. Owing to this feeling I took the precaution
to lock the drawing-room door. No one could enter
the bedroom without coming through the drawing-room
first. We felt, therefore, reasonably secure. In addition
to my watch and chain, there was Mrs. Sandow’s jewellery,
which she had worn at the ball, whilst, amongst other special
things, I had five twenty dollar pieces, which I had bought
because of their rare dates. These gold pieces I left in my
clothes in the bathroom; Mrs. Sandow’s jewellery remained
in a drawer in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Through the night we slept without disturbance. In the
morning the servant who came to look after our clothes
noticed that my watch chain had been broken and that my
watch was missing. The five twenty dollar pieces were also
gone, but Mrs. Sandow’s jewellery was untouched.</p>

<p>Questioned as to how she got into the room, the girl said
that the door was open. Someone had evidently broken
into our rooms whilst we slept and had worked so quietly
that they had not disturbed us.</p>

<p>A detective was called, and it was ascertained that shortly
after we returned from the ball two well dressed men entered
the hotel and asked for rooms on the first floor. It was
then between two and three o’clock. Before five o’clock
they left. The detective remarked that about that hour
two men answering the description that was given had been
seen to enter a train, and he thought he would be able to
succeed in tracing them. I told him that if he brought my
watch back he should be well rewarded.</p>

<p>When the rooms were examined it was found that the
door had been opened by means of an instrument which was
pushed through the keyhole to turn the key. The gas had
been half turned on during the night, and no doubt they
saw my watch-chain shining in the uncertain light, and
decided to take those things that they could lay their hands
on most easily without fear of waking us. It might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
been supposed to be risky work to rob a strong man; but,
on the other hand, it was found afterwards that the burglar
was a desperate fellow, who had just completed nineteen
years’ penal servitude for shooting a man who was unfortunate
enough to wake up whilst he was rifling his room.</p>

<p>During the day the two men were arrested. Four of the
twenty-dollar pieces were found on them, but the watch was
still missing. The men were taken before the police
authorities, but on the ground that the case was not fully
proved they were dismissed. After this decision, the detective
came to me to ask what the watch was worth. Five
hundred pounds I told him, in actual money, but for me it
had a priceless value, and not for five thousand pounds
would I willingly part with it.</p>

<p>“Seeing that it is worth so much,” he said, “I will try
to get it for you if you will promise to give me £800.”</p>

<p>At this moment I realised the situation; at any rate I
felt justified in believing that this so-called detective was in
league with the burglars, who had themselves owned in
court that they knew where the watch was, though they
refused flatly to give the information. Feeling disgusted
with a man who could thus play so false and mean a game I
took him by his neck and trousers and sent him flying
through the door.</p>

<p>From that day to this I have never seen anything of my
watch. It is, no doubt, lost to me for ever. If I had had
my dog with me that night it would never have been stolen,
for no burglar would have got past Sultan, however clever he
might be at picking locks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Throughout my tour I offered medals to those of my
pupils who were able to show the highest developments
under my system of physical training. Thousands of applications
were received, and the amount of my correspondence
was enormous. In the end I arranged a meeting, at which
the pupils stripped for my personal examination, and there
the awards were made.</p>

<p>I received also several challenges during my tour. These
challenges were frequently made after I had left a city, and
as it came to be clear that those who made them merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
sought advertisement by associating their names with mine,
I deposited ten thousand dollars with the “New York
Herald” on the understanding that anyone who seriously
meant business should also make a deposit as a guarantee of
his good faith. If he duplicated my feats of strength the
money would be his. But though this sum was deposited for
about nine months I never received an answer. No one
ever attempted to win that ten thousand dollars and I have
the original cheque, made out to James Gordon-Bennett, to
this day. I have had it framed and preserve it as a
memento.</p>

<p>At the end of my first tour in America I returned to
England, engaged fresh talent for my company, and
invented and practised some new feats of strength,
including that which I have entitled the Roman horse
exercise, and that in which two people drive over me with
a horse and chariot. Afterwards I paid a short return
visit to America, to fulfil certain engagements, and then
came back again to London.</p>

<small>MY PERFORMANCE AT THE PRESENT TIME.</small></h3></div>


<p>It may be useful, as a record, to indicate briefly the nature
of the salient features of my recent performance at the
London Pavilion, and since in the provinces.</p>

<p>To begin with there is a tableau, arranged for the purpose
of showing muscular repose, with all the muscles relaxed;
muscular tension, with all the muscles as firm as steel; the
abdominal muscles; the biceps, muscles of the inside of the
upper arm; the triceps, muscles of the back of the upper
arm; the deltoid, muscles of the shoulders; the trapezius
muscle, which raises the shoulders; the muscles of the back;
the action and uses of different muscles; and the chest
expansion, from 48ins. normal to 62ins.</p>

<p>The tableau curtains are drawn, and the scene changes
to the arena. Resting with my neck on one trestle and my
heels on another, I hold a 56lb. weight in each hand at arms’
length and support four men simultaneously on my body. For
the performance of this feat it may be mentioned that
exceptionally strong neck and abdominal muscles are
necessary.</p>

<p>Taking a pack of ordinary playing cards I tear
them first in half, then in four parts, and finally
into eighths. Next I tear two packs, and finally
three packs, each pack containing the ordinary
number of fifty-two cards. The feat of tearing in half
one pack of cards was originally shown to me by the late
Emperor of Russia. My reputation as an amateur had
reached his Imperial Majesty, who paid me the honour of
commanding my presence. During that interview his
Majesty, as a test of his own manual strength, took a pack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of cards and tore it, as I have said, in halves. He had never
tried more than the one pack, but as is apparent I have
succeeded with three, the torn cards being distributed each
evening amongst the audience.</p>

<p>Another feat is performed lying prone on the ground.
From this position I lift with one hand a Roman chariot,
rising upright with it and afterwards lying down again.
This feat brings the whole of the muscles into play.</p>

<p>I also introduce my Roman horse exercise. Sitting on a
horse and so bending my back as to throw my head over
the animal’s tail I raise at arms’ length heavy weights from
the ground. Next I pick up two men, one after the other,
raising them over my head and seating them in the
saddle.</p>

<p>Another interesting feat consists of lifting a man from a
prone position on the ground to the horse’s back, using one
hand only.</p>

<p>As a concluding feat, I support on my chest a bridge
weighing 800 lbs. Over this bridge two persons drive a
horse and chariot, making a total weight of about 3,200 lbs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, I conclude my performance by lifting
with one hand at arm’s length a platform upon which rests
an ordinary piano, with a man seated playing upon it.
Having lifted it, I march off the stage with the lot, the
musician playing a lively tune as we go.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to enumerate all my feats here; of
course my performance has been varied from time to time.
But a number of other feats have been referred to in the
body of the book.</p>

<p>It may be interesting, perhaps, to add that I have
recently composed a musical march, entitled “Marche des
Athlètes,” as well as a waltz, “Sandowia” and other pieces,
which musicians have been kind enough to commend for
their brightness and originality.</p>

<p>As a supplement to the previous chapter it may be stated
here, in answer to many inquiries, that my own measurements,
etc., at the present time are as set forth below. The
first edition of the book was written rather hurriedly, and
consequently one or two trifling inaccuracies crept in.

<p>My strength, it may be added, is steadily increasing. If
some one had told me two years ago that I should be able
to perform the feats of strength that I now accomplish I
would not have believed it. I feel sure, moreover, that in
the natural course of things, my strength will continue to
increase. With careful training the bodily strength ought
to increase steadily until the forty-fifth year is reached.</p>

<p>The above appeared in the first edition. Pupils will be
glad to hear that my belief has been fully justified, and that
even since the book was first published, some eighteen
months ago, there has been a very material increase in my
strength.</p>

<p class="half-title">MY “GRIP”<br />
DUMB-BELL.</p>

<p>The ordinary Dumb-bell, though
excellent in itself, has one great
defect, which I have been conscious
of for years. In prescribing exercises
for my pupils I am compelled to trust
entirely to them as to the amount
of will-power used whilst exercising. They may work
energetically or slovenly according to their condition, but
how they work is beyond my knowledge or control.</p>

<p>How to combat this has long engaged my attention, and
after long years of study and experiment I have at last
discovered a Dumb-bell which absolutely compels the pupil
to throw the necessary amount of will-power into his work.</p>

<p>This appliance is very simple, and cannot go out of order.
It consists of a Dumb-bell made in two halves, separated
about 1½ inches from one another, the intervening space
being occupied by small steel springs, which may be of any
strength.</p>

<p>When exercising, the springs are compressed by gripping
the Bells, and bringing the two halves close together, in which
position they are kept until the exercise is over.</p>

<p>The pupil who possesses these Bells will find that instead
of having to be continually buying heavier Dumb-bells, one
pair will suffice him for all time. All that it will be necessary
for him to do will be to purchase, at a small expense, new
springs from time to time. All pupils are advised to use the
“Grip” Dumb-bell upon the merits of which I need not
enlarge.</p>

<p>I have always taught that muscle is developed by will-power,
not by mechanical movement, and the simple principle
of this latest invention is, by calling forth a continual exercise
of will-power to obtain results impossible with any previous
Dumb-bell.</p>

pressed against the fair one’s bosom. It is unnecessary to say more than that the rest of

its own which deserves recognition, even by those who do not profess to admire the
methods of the sensation-storyteller.”—<i>Court Circular.</i></p>

<p class="center">WHAT THE PRESS SAYS.</p>

<p class="center">From the TIMES, January, 1899.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not the members of the House of Commons but those of the Stock Exchange are
responsible for the collection of articles upon sports and pastimes and the collection of
records published under the title <span class="smcap">The “House” on Sport</span> and edited by Mr. W. A.
Morgan. Of its success the names of the contributors are almost a certain guarantee,
for the greater number of them are, or have been in their day, among the most
celebrated exponents of the sports and pastimes upon which they discourse. It is
impossible to name all the writers, but a selection will serve the purpose of showing the
authority and experience with which these gentlemen write. Mr. W. M. Chinnery
treats of Athletic Sports and Athletes&mdash;his achievements on the running path in the
’sixties were great. Mr. B. J. Angle, a veteran enthusiast, contributes a very interesting
article on “The Noble Art,” in which will be found not only the records of the
prowess of fighters of old time but also the keen criticism of an expert upon the modern
style of boxing as compared with the old time method. * * * Of Cricket, Messrs.
Gregor MacGregor and C. Carlos Clarke write; and of Cycling Mr. G. Lacy Hillier,
acknowledged to be the highest authority, gives the history, to which he adds useful
suggestions. * * * The various epochs of Rugby Football fall into the hands of Messrs.
W. Maclagan, G. L. Jeffery, and A. Spurling, and Mr. S. Mure Fergusson has a useful
little essay on Golf. Still one well-known name follows another until the reader begins
to think that the Stock Exchange is the very home of sport. * * * The articles likely to
attract the greatest share of attention are those dealing with Metropolitan and
University Rowing and on Sculling. Mr. Morgan had, no doubt, plenty of talent to
choose from. But to have been able to collect in one volume the views of Messrs. S.
Le Blanc Smith, F. I. Pitman, S. D. Muttlebury, Reginald P. P. Rowe, and Guy
Nickalls is a real triumph. That which they do not know of oarsmanship is not worth
knowing. * * * Many articles have been passed over of necessity, but enough has been
written to show that this is a pleasant and useful book, the work of men who speak
from experience; it is generously illustrated, mainly with good reproductions of
photographs.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        works.

        receipt of the work.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
